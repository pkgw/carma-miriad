.SH NAME
wcsware \- Extract WCS keywords for an image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wcsware
[\fI-a<alt>\fR] [\fI-f\fR] [\fI-h<hdu>\fR] [\fI-p\fR] [\fI-x\fR] [\fI<fitsfile>\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
wcsware extracts the WCS keywords for an image from the specified FITS
file, constructs wcsprm structs for each coordinate representation found
and performs a variety of operations using them.
.PP
The FITS file may be specified according to the syntax understood by
cfitsio, for example "file.fits.gz+1" refers to the first extension of
a gzip'd FITS file.  Use "\-" or omit the file name for input from stdin.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-a\fR<alt>
Specify an alternate coordinate representation to be used
(ignored if there is only one).
.TP
\fB\-f\fR
Apply wcsfix() to the header.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR<hdu>
Move to HDU number (1\-relative) which is expected to
contain an image array.  (Useful for input from stdin.)
.TP
\fB\-p\fR
Print the struct(s) using wcsprt() (default operation).
.TP
\fB\-P\fR
Same as \fB\-p\fR but don't print a default struct.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR
Convert pixel coordinates, obtained from stdin, to world
coordinates using wcsp2s().
.TP
\fB\-w\fR
Convert world coordinates, obtained from stdin, to pixel
coordinates using wcss2p().
