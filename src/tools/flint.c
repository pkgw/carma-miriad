  Flint is a FORTRAN checker. It takes FORTRAN code as its input, and
  generates warnings about dubious FORTRAN. These messages are written
  both to the terminal, and a listing file.

  History:
    rjs  ??????? Original version.
    rjs   4oct89 Fixed implied-do-loop bug on write statements.
		 Recognised VMS continuation (but complains). Fixed
		 a bug for COMMON blocks containing array declarations, and
		 mixing numerics and characters.
    rjs   1nov89 Fixed it so that it notices two consecutive commas in a 
		 routine call or argument list.
    rjs   3feb90 Fixed spurious complaint about subroutine or function
		 calls which did not contain any arguments. Better checking
		 for argument type consistency of generic functions.
    rjs   8feb90 Fixed a bug I introduced on 3feb90.
    rjs  12feb90 Fixed another bug I introduced on 3feb90.
    pjt  30apr90 Add I flag for search-include files
    pjt  13may90 renamed the 'i' flag to a 'j' flag for VMS (I for include)
    pjt  21jun90 warn if intrinsic functions are used as variables
    rjs  17oct90 Made -i synomous with -I for the sake of VMS.
    rjs  13nov90 Some support for "double complex" statement.
    rjs   7dec90 Added a missing "end comment" character.
    rjs  21dec90 Check for doubly declared variables. Better redundant arg
		 messages. Fixed bug checking for functions with no args.
		 Tidied pjt's check for intrinsics.
   rjs   10jan91 Better cross reference listing.
   pjt   20jan91 changed some doc's (more alpha)
   rjs   22jan91 Merged pjt and rjs versions.
   rjs   30jan91 Fixed bug so that complex values can contain + and - signs.
   rjs   17jul91 Better handles statements starting with "do" (e.g.
		 do-loops and double). Check nesting of do/enddo, if/endif, etc.
   rjs   22jul91 Better treatment at END statement and missing END statements.
   rjs   24jul91 Better treatment of bad if/elsseif statements.
   rjs    9oct91 Mods to get flint to recognise some forms of character
		 assignment and declaration that it was failing to before,
		 as found by bpw.
   rjs   10mar92 Crude support for EQUIVALENCE statements.
   rjs   16mar92 -k switch to suppress common block warnings.
		 Statement label checking.
   rjs   26mar92 Suppress some warnings about things starting with % (i.e.
		 VMS functions).
   rjs   21may92 Handle err=label.
   rjs   16jun92 Fixed bug dealing with mixing tabs and spaces at start of line.
   rjs    2sep92 You can use multiple -I switches.
   rjs   24dec92 Fixed incrementing bug if checking for invalid command lines.
   rjs    9aug93 Exit (rather than return) with 0, to appease VAXs.
   rjs   25aug93 Don't complain about lack of initialisation for variables
		 appearing in equivalences.
   rjs   20sep94 Eliminate bug dealing with blank lines.
   rjs   30sep94 Check ends of ENDDO, ENDIF, ELSE statements.
   rjs   25nov95 Fix EQUIVALENCE handling, better treatment of exclamations,
		 do-loop variables. Flag VMS record structures.

/*+
  Flint is a FORTRAN checker, producing warnings about non-standard,
  possibly incorrect or poor FORTRAN code.

  Flint takes a large number of flags, to attempt to keep the error 
  messages that it generates down to manageable proportions. The 
  command format is:

   flint [-acdfhjkrsux2?] [-I dir] [-o file] [-l] file ...

    a    make crude list of all variables used
    c    Allow comments and continuation lines to be interwoven. 
         Normally flint flags this as an error.
    d    Do not insist that variables are always explicitly declared.
    f    Disable "line checks".
    h    Crude treatment of hollerith.
    k    Do not warn about COMMON block alignment problems.
    j    Do not check if a variable has been initialised.
    r    Do not warn about seemingly redundant variables.
    s    Load the definitions of specific functions and FORTRAN-IV
         standard function.
    u    Do not worry about unused variables.
    x    Allow names longer than 8 characters.
    2    Flint performs two passes.
    ?    Print a message describing the flags.

    o    Generate output file giving subroutine definitions only. The 
         next command line argument gives the output file name.
    l    The following file is to be processed in "library mode". This
         means that the file is not echoed to flint.log, and that errors
         detected are to be ignored.
    I    add a directory to search for include files.
    i    Equivalent to "I".

  Flint is NOT intended to replace compiler checks.  Flint is blind
  to much bad code that any compiler will pick up. However you might
  find flint's log file useful when doing initial source code corrections
  after writing a piece of code.					*/
/*-- */
/*

  Checks Flint performs include:
    * undeclared variables.
    * variable declared but never used.
    * variables used before being assigned.
    * variables assigned to but not otherwise used.
    * names longer than 8 characters, or containing $ or _ characters.
    * lines longer than 72 characters, or containing an odd number of
      quote characters.
    * subroutine argument consistency: number, type and intent.
    * possible common block alignment problems.

  Areas for Improvement:
    * Improved error checking and handling.
    * Improve "initialisation checking" algorithm.
    * Consistency in common block definition. Checks could include 
      common block size, variable type matching, and even variable 
      name matching.
    * Better checks for illegal mixed expressions (i.e. mixing integers 
      and logicals).
    * Passing character expressions containing char*(*) variables.
    * Parsing of DATA statements is very crude.
    * SAVE statement usage.
    * Treatment of EQUIVALENCE statement is very crude.

  Things Flint does not understand:
    * ASSIGN
    * Assigned GOTO
    * PAUSE
    * ENTRY
    * alternate returns
    * many archaic i/o statements
    * much non-standard FORTRAN

  Flint ignores:
    * IMPLICIT
    * FORMAT

  Recognised FORTRAN extensions:
    * INTENT statement
    * DO/ENDDO, DOWHILE/ENDDO
    * # to start comments
    * tabs and full ascii character set.

  There are some places where better use could have been made of stdio.
  However Flint is intended to work on a number of systems, and so
  it has been written to avoid some bugs in some non-UNIX stdio packages.
  Systems on which Flint is believed to work are Berkeley UNIX (Sun, 
  Alliant, Convex), UNICOS, VMS, Turbo-C (MS-DOS) and CTSS (hcc 
  compiler).

  Basic Workings
  ==============
  Flint maintains two (hash) tables which contain all Flint info about
  variables and subroutines. Almost always, these hash tables are 
  accessed through the set_variable and set_routine subroutines. The 
  caller passes in whatever it knows about the variable or routine, 
  and the set_? routine passes back the accumulated knowledge about 
  the variable or routine. set_variable and set_routine are responsible 
  for generating many warnings. 

  Determining Intent
  ==================
  Flint attempts to uncover the intent of subroutine arguments. It 
  gleans information from both calls to the routine and the source of 
  the routine itself (if available).

  The following rules are used when analysing a call to a routine:
  * Arguments which are passed in as constants, expressions or parameters
    are input! Arguments which are input dummy arguments to the current
    routine are also deemed to be inputs. These rules are reliable.
  * Arguments which are variables which have not been initialised are
    assumed to be output. Also arguments which are output dummy arguments
    to the current routine, and have not yet been initialised, are also
    deemed to be outputs. These rules depend on the accuracy of the
    initialisation checking algorithm, which can be inaccurate. These
    rules are disabled if initialisation checking is disabled.

  The following rules are used when analysing the source of the routine.
  * Dummy arguments which are used as input only are clearly input. This
    rule is reliable.
  * Dummy arguments which are assigned to before they are used, are 
    deemed as output. This rule depends on the initialisation checking 
    algorithm, and is turned off, if initialisation checking is turned 
    off.
  * Dummy arguments which are used and then assigned to are deemed to
    be input/output. 

  What goes on when dummy arguments are passed to subroutines produces 
  much recursive thought. There are some instances where Flint has to 
  discard some hard won information, because there are too few flags 
  to describe all the contortions that can occur.

  Flags and Hash Tables
  =====================
  Each entry in the "vhash" hash table consists of a name and set of 
  flags. These are mostly just variables, but they also contain entries 
  for each EXTERNAL and each function or subroutine called (except the
  FORTRAN intrinsics?).

  Each entry in the "rhash" hash table is a subroutine or function 
  definition. Each definition consists of the name, flags for the 
  routine, the number of subroutine arguments, and an array of flags, 
  one for each argument. Entries for FORTRAN intrinsics appear in this 
  table.

  The meaning of most flags (I hope) is fairly clear, but
  F_IN,F_OUT,F_PIN,F_POUT require more attention. For a variable,
  F_IN and F_OUT is set if the variable has been used as source or
  destination of an operation, respectively. F_PIN is set for subroutine
  arguments, indicating that this variable may have been passed in by the
  caller. If Flint determines that this is not so, then this flag is
  turned off. F_POUT indicates that this variable may have been passed
  out by a subroutine. 

  For a subroutine or function, these flags are used only in the
  vhash table. F_IN and F_OUT indicate that the routine
  has been called. F_PIN is always set if it was a dummy argument.
  F_POUT is set if it was passed to a subroutine.

  For a routine argument (in the "rhash" table), F_IN and F_OUT means
  passed in and passed out. An absence of these indicates that Flint 
  does not know.                                                       */
