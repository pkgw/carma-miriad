c= invert - Transform multi-pointing visibility data into a map
c& rjs
c: map making
c+
c	INVERT is a MIRIAD task which forms images from visibilities.
c	INVERT can form continuum images or spectral line cubes. It
c	can generate images/cubes for several polarisations, as well
c	as handling multi-frequency synthesis and mosaicing observations.
c	INVERT can also form complex-valued images from non-Hermitian data
c	(e.g. holography data). Appropriate point-spread functions can also
c	be generated.
c@ vis
c	Input visibility data files. Several files can be given. No default.
c@ map
c	Output map (image) file name. Each output file consists of a single
c	polarization/Stokes parameter. If several different pols/Stokes
c	images are being made, then several file names should be given. No
c	default.
c@ beam
c	Output beam (point-spread function) file name. The default is not
c	to make a beam.
c@ imsize
c	The size of the output dataset. The default is to image out to
c	primary beam half power points. For options=mosaic, an image of
c	this size is made for each pointing before a linear mosaic
c	operation is performed. 
c@ cell
c	Image cell size, in arcsec. If two values are given, they give
c	the RA and DEC cell sizes. If only one value is given, the cells
c	are made square. The default is about one third of the resolution
c	of the resultant images.
c@ offset
c	When not mosaicing, this gives the sky position to shift to the
c	center of the output images. The position is specified as an
c	offset (in arcsec) from the observing center. The default is to
c	perform no shifting.
c
c	When mosaicing, this gives the sky coordinate (RA and DEC) of the
c	reference pixel in the imaging process. The value can be given in the
c	form hh:mm:ss,dd:mm:ss, or as decimal hours and degrees. INVERT
c	applies appropriate shifts to make this location fall on a pixel.
c	The default is a central observing center.
c@ fwhm
c	This determines a gaussian taper to apply to the visibility data.
c	It specifies the FWHM of an image-domain gaussian -- tapering the
c	visibility data is equivalent to convolving with this image-domain
c	gaussian.
c
c	Either one or two values can be given, in arcsec, being the FWHM in
c	the RA and DEC directions. If only one value is given, the taper is
c	assumed to be symmetric. The default is no taper.
c
c	The signal-to-noise ratio will be optimised in the output image if
c	this parameter is set to the FWHM of typical image features of
c	interest.
c
c	If you are more accustomed to giving this parameter in the uv plane
c	(as AIPS requires), then:
c	  fwhm(image plane) = 182 / fwhm(uv plane)
c	where the image plane fwhm is measured in arcseconds, and the uv plane
c	fwhm is measured in kilowavelengths.
c@ sup
c	Sidelobe suppression area, given in arcseconds. This parameter
c	gives the area around a source where INVERT attempts to suppress
c	sidelobes. Two values (for the RA and DEC directions respectively)
c	can be given. If only one value is given, the suppression area is
c	made square. The default is to suppress sidelobes in an area as
c	large as the field being mapped.
c
c	The suppression area is essentially an alternate way of specifying
c	the weighting scheme being used. Suppressing sidelobes in the entire
c	field corresponds to uniform weighting (so the default corresponds to
c	uniform weighting). Natural weighting gives the best signal to noise
c	ratio, at the expense of no sidelobe suppression. Natural weighting
c	corresponds to SUP=0. Values between these extremes give a tradeoff
c	between signal to noise and sidelobe suppression, and roughly
c	correspond to AIPS ``super-uniform'' weighting.
c@ robust
c	Brigg's visibility weighting robustness parameter. This parameter
c	can be used to down-weight excessive weight being given to
c	visibilities in relatively sparsely filled regions of the $u-v$ plane.
c	Most useful settings are in the range [-2,2], with values less than
c	-2 corresponding to very little down-weighting, and values greater than
c	+2 reducing the weighting to natural weighting. 
c
c	Sidelobe levels and beam-shape degrade with increasing values of
c	robustness, but the theoretical noise level will also decrease.
c
c	The default is no down-weighting (robust=-infinity).
c@ line
c	Standard "line" parameter, with the normal defaults. In particular,
c	the default is to image all channels. See the help on "line" for 
c	more information.
c	The "line" parameter consists of a string followed by up to 
c	four numbers, viz:
c
c	  linetype,nchan,start,width,step
c
c	where ``linetype'' is one of "channel", "wide", "velocity" or
c	"felocity".
c@ ref
c	Line type of the reference channel, specified in a similar to the
c	"line" parameter. Specifically, it is in the form:
c	  linetype,start,width
c	Before mapping, the visibility data are divided by the reference
c	channel. The default is no reference channel.
c@ select
c	This allows a subset of the uv data to be used in the mapping
c	process. See the Users Manual for information on how to specify
c	this parameter. The default is to use all data.
c@ stokes
c	Standard polarisation/Stokes parameter selection. See the help
c	on "stokes" for more information. Several polarisations can be
c	given. The default is ``ii'' (i.e. Stokes-I, given the
c	assumption that the source is unpolarised).
c@ options
c	This gives extra processing options. Several options can be
c	given (abbreviated to uniqueness), and separated by commas:
c	  nocal    Do not apply gains table calibration to the data.
c	  nopol    Do not apply polarisation leakage corrections.
c	  nopass   Do not apply bandpass table calibration to the data.
c	  double   Normally INVERT makes the beam patterns the same
c	           size as the output image. This option causes the
c	           beam patterns to be twice as large.
c	  systemp  Weight each visibility in inverse proportion to the
c	           noise variance. Normally visibilities are weighted in
c	           proportion to integration time. Weighting based on the
c	           noise variance optimises the signal-to-noise ratio
c	           (provided the measures of the system temperature are
c	           reliable!).
c	  mfs      Perform multi-frequency synthesis. The causes all the
c	           channel data to be used in forming a single map. The
c	           frequency dependence of the uv coordinate is thus used to
c	           give better uv coverage and/or avoid frequency
c	           smearing. For this option to produce useful maps, the
c	           intensity change over the frequency band must be small.
c	           You should set the ``line'' parameter to select the
c	           channels that you wish to grid.
c	  sdb      Generate the spectral dirty beam as well as the normal
c	           beam, when MFS processing. The default is to only create
c	           the normal beam. If the spectral dirty beam is created,
c	           this is saved as an extra plane in the beam dataset.
c	  mosaic   Process multiple pointings, and generate a linear
c	           mosaic of these pointings.
c	  imaginary Make imaginary image for non-Hermitian data (holography).
c	  amplitude Produce a image using the data amplitudes only. The
c	            phases of the data are set to zero.
c	  phase     Produce an image using the data phase only. The amplitudes
c	            of the data are set to 1.
c@ mode
c	This determines the algorithm to be used in imaging.
c	Possible values are:
c	  fft    The conventional grid-and-FFT approach. This is the default
c	         and by far the fastest.
c	  dft    Use a discrete Fourier transform. This avoids aliasing
c	         but at a hugh time penalty.
c	  median This uses a median approach. This is generally robust to 
c	         bad data and sidelobes, has a even larger time penalty
c	         and produces images that cannot be deconvolved.
c	NOTE: Dft and median modes are not supported with options=mosaic.
c@ slop
c	NOTE: This parameter should be used with caution! See the Users
c	Guide for more information on its applicability.
c
c	When forming spectral cubes, INVERT normally insists
c	that all channels in a given visibility spectrum must be good before
c	accepting the spectrum for imaging. This keyword allows this rule to
c	be relaxed. It consists of two parts: a tolerance and a method for
c	replacing the bad channels.
c
c	The tolerance is a value between 0 and 1, giving the fraction of
c	channels that INVERT will tolerate as being bad before the spectrum
c	is totally discarded. The default is 0, indicating that INVERT will
c	not tolerate any bad channels. A value of 1 indicates that INVERT
c	will accept a spectrum as long as there is at least one good channel.
c
c	The replacement method is either the value `zero' or `interpolate',
c	indicating that the bad channels are either to be replaced with
c	0, or to be estimated by linear interpolation of two adjacent good
c	channels. See the Users Guide for the merits and evils of the two
c	approaches. The default is `zero'.
