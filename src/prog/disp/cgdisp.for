c= CGDISP - displays and overlays images on a PGPLOT device
c& nebk
c: plotting
c+
c	CGDISP displays/overlays images via contour plots, pixel map
c	representations, vectors and scaled boxes on a PGPLOT device. 
c	Upto 3 contour plots, one pixel map, one vector plot and one box 
c	display may be overlaid in multi-panel plots of multi-channel 
c	images.  In addition overlay locations (plotted as boxes, stars,
c	circles, lines or see-through) may be specified from an ascii 
c	text file.
c
c	Manipulation of the device colour lookup table is available
c	when you display with a pixel map representation (formerly
c	called a "grey scale")
c
c@ in
c	You may input up to 7 images.  Upto 3 of these can be displayed 
c	via contour plots and 1 can be displayed via a colour pixel map 
c	representation.  1 vector amplitude image and 1 vector position
c	angle image (degrees; positive N -> E) can together be used to
c	display a vector map (e.g. polarization vectors).  1 image can
c	be displayed as small scaled boxes (see below) and 1 image may be
c	used as a mask.  
c
c	The "box" image is displayed by drawing little boxes (solid and
c	hollow for positive and negative pixels) at the location of each
c	selected pixel.  The size of the box scales with the value of the
c	pixel.  This is a useful way to display rotation measure images 
c	for example. The mask image blanking mask is logically ANDed to all
c	the other image masks before they are displayed. The mask image 
c	is not displayed.
c
c	If more than one image is specified, they must have identical 
c	first and second dimensions.  However, you can overlay combinations
c	of 2-D with 3-D images (e.g. multi-channel images with a continuum 
c	image) provided all the 3-D images have the same third dimension. 
c	These images can be input in any order (see TYPE).
c	Wild card expansion is supported.    No default.
c@ type
c	Specifies the type of each image, respectively, listed in the IN 
c	keyword. Minimum match is supported (note that "pixel" was 
c	formerly "grey" [which is still supported]).   Choose from:
c
c	 "contour"   (contour;            up to 3 of these)
c	 "pixel"     (pixel map;          up to 1 of these)
c	 "amplitude" (vector amplitude;   up to 1 of these)
c	 "angle"     (vector pos'n angle; up to 1 of these)
c	 "box"       (box;                up to 1 of these)
c	 "mask"      (mask;               up to 1 of these)
c
c	You can't give one of "amplitude" or "angle" without the other.
c	Default is "pixel" for one image, "contour" if more than one.
c@ region
c	Region of interest.  Choose only one spatial region (bounding box
c	only supported), but as many spectral regions (i.e., multiple 
c	IMAGE specifications) as you like.   Each channel (or group of 
c	channels; see CHAN below) is drawn on a new sub-plot.  
c	NOTE: the region specification applies equally to all the 
c	input images.
c	Default is full image
c@ xybin
c	Upto 4 values.  These give the spatial increment and binning
c	size in pixels for the x and y axes to be applied to the selected
c	region.   If the binning size is not unity, it must equal the 
c	increment.  For example, to bin up the image by 4 pixels in 
c	the x direction and to pick out every third pixel in the y 
c	direction, set XYBIN=4,4,3,1
c	Defaults are 1,XYBIN(1),XYBIN(1),XYBIN(3)
c@ chan
c	2 values. The first is the channel increment to step through the
c	image in, the second is the number of channels to average, for 
c	each sub-plot.  Thus CHAN=5,3  would average groups of 3 channels 
c	together, starting 5 channels apart such as: 1:3, 6:8, 11:13 ...  
c 	The channels available are those designated by the REGION keyword.
c	A new group of channels (sub-plot) is started if there is a 
c	discontinuity in the REGION selected channels (such as 
c	IMAGE(10,20),IMAGE(22,30).  The combination of REGION and CHAN 
c	determines how many sub-plots there will be.
c
c	In the case that you have input some combination of 2-D and 3-D
c	images, CHAN refers to the 3-D image(s). Note that a channel
c	is defined to be a pixel on the third axis of a cube, regardless
c	of the cube's order (xyv or vxy say).
c	Defaults are 1,1
c@ slev
c	Up to 3 pairs of values, one for contour image. First value is 
c	the type of contour level scale factor.  "p" for percentage and 
c	"a" for absolute.   Second value is the factor to scale LEVS by. 
c	Thus, SLEV=p,1  would contour levels at LEVS * 1% of the image 
c	peak intensity.  Similarly, SLEV=a,1.4e-2 would contour levels 
c	at LEVS * 1.4E-2
c	Default is no additional scaling of LEVS (i.e., "a",1.0)
c@ levs1
c	The levels to contour for the first specified contour image are 
c	LEVS1 times SLEV (either percentage of the image peak or absolute).
c	Defaults try to choose something vaguely useful.
c@ levs2
c	LEVS for the second contour image.
c@ levs3
c	LEVS for the third contour image.
c@ cols1
c	PGPLOT colours for LEVS1 contours. 0 is background colour, 1 
c	foreground, others are different colours. If you give one value
c	it is used for all contours.
c@ range
c	N groups of 4 values (1 group per subplot and N is the maximum
c	number of channels allowed by Miriad; typically 2048). These are 
c	the image intensity range to display (min to max), the transfer 
c	function type and the colour lookup table for each subplot 
c	displayed.  The transfer function type can be one of "lin" 
c	(linear), "sqr" (square root), "log" (logarithmic), and "heq" 
c	(histogram equalization).  The colour lookup table is an integer 
c	from 1 to 8 specifying a lookup table. Valud values are 1 (b&w),
c	2 (rainbow), 3 (linear pseudo colour), 4 (floating zero colour 
c	contours), 5 (fixed zero colour contours), 6 (rgb), 7 (background)
c	8 (heat) and 9 (absolute b&w) .  If you enter a negative 
c	integer, then the reversed lookup table is displayed.  
c
c	The transfer function changes available with OPTIONS=FIDDLE 
c	are in addition (on top of) to the selections here, but the 
c	colour lookup table selections will replace those selected here.
c
c	All subplots following the last one with a specified "range"
c	will use the "range" settings from the previous subplot. In
c	this way, one group of settings can be applied to all the 
c	subplots if desired.  The multiple subplot capability is useful
c	if you have used IMCAT to put unlike images into planes of
c	a cube and you wish to display them together.
c
c	Default is linear between the image minimum and maximum with
c	a b&w lookup table.   You can default the intensity range with
c	zeros, viz. "range=0,0,log,-2" say.
c@ vecfac
c       3 or 4 values.  A scale factor to multiply the vector image
c       lengths (or box image widths) by, the x and y increments (in
c       pixels) across the image at which to plot the vectors (or boxes),
c       and optionally the length of the scale-bar vector
c       (unset for no scale-bar). If you have set non unit values of
c       XYBIN, the increments here refer to the binned pixels.  When
c       VECFAC(1)=1, the vectors (boxes) are scaled so that the maximum
c       amplitude (width) takes 1/20 of the (sub)plot size. 
c
c       The scale-bar gives a graphical representation of the vector
c       lengths, which makes vector plots easier to interpret.  The
c       scale-bar is drawn in the corner specified by the BEAMTYP key
c       (defaulting to bottom-left if BEAMTYP is not specified). If
c       VECFAC(4)=0, the scale bar is drawn the length of the longest
c       vector; you can find out what this is using OPTIONS=FULL. For a
c       fractional polarization vector map, setting VECFAC(4)=1
c       corresponds to 100 per cent polarization. If VECFAC(1) >> 1, this
c       will give a very long vector. For polarization intensity images,
c       VECFAC(4) is specified in flux density.
c
c	Defaults are 1.0, 2, VECFAC(2)
c       Default is not to draw a scale-bar.
c@ boxfac
c	3 values.  A scale factor to multiply the box image widths by, 
c	and the x and y increments (in pixels) across the image at which
c	to plot the boxes).  If have set non unit values of XYBIN, the 
c	increments here refer to the binned pixels.  When BOXFAC(1)=1, 
c	the boxes are scaled so that there is a little bit of space
c	between adjacent boxes.
c	Defaults are 1.0, 2, BOXFAC(2)
c@ device
c	The PGPLOT plot device, such as plot.plt/ps 
c	No default.
c@ nxy
c	Number of sub-plots in the x and y directions on the page. 
c	Defaults choose something depending on your telescope.
c@ labtyp
c	Up to 2 values.  The spatial label type of the x and y axes.
c	Minimum match is active.  Select from:
c
c	 "hms"       the label is in H M S.S (e.g. for RA)
c	 "dms"       the label is in D M S.S (e.g. for DEC)
c	 "arcsec"    the label is in arcsecond offsets
c	 "arcmin"    the label is in arcminute offsets
c	 "absdeg"    the label is in degrees
c	 "reldeg"    the label is in degree offsets
c	             The above assume the pixel increment is in radians.
c	 "abspix"    the label is in pixels
c	 "relpix"    the label is in pixel offsets
c	 "abskms"    the label is in km/s
c	 "relkms"    the label is in km/s offsets
c	 "absghz"    the label is in GHz
c	 "relghz"    the label is in GHz offsets
c	 "absnat"    the label is in natural coordinates as defined by 
c	             the header. 
c	 "relnat"    the label is in offset natural coordinates
c	 "none"      no label and no numbers or ticks on the axis
c
c	All offsets are from the reference pixel.  
c	Defaults are "relpix", LABTYP(1)   except if LABTYP(1)="hms" when
c	LABTYP(2) defaults to "dms"  (to give RA and DEC)
c@ beamtyp
c     Up to 6 values. Set if you want a small polygon to be drawn to
c     represent the beam FWHM. Setting beamtyp to "b,l" is sufficient to
c     draw a solid beam; "b,l,4" will result in a cross-hatched
c     beam. The six parameters are:
c
c     - Beam vertical positioning: can be "t" (top), or "b" (bottom). No
c       default.
c     - Beam horizontal positioning: can be "l" (left), or "r"
c       (right). Default "l"
c
c     The next four parameters apply only to the first image specified
c     with the "in" keyword.  If there are multiple, different beams to
c     draw (for example, if different uv data were used to produce
c     images with different beam shapes), all subsequent beams are drawn 
c     as open polygons.
c
c     - Hatching style:
c        1    solid (default)
c        2    outline
c        3    hatched
c        4    cross-hatched
c     - Hatching angle (default 45 degrees).
c     - Hatching line separation (default 1).
c     - Line-width for outlines, hatching and cross-hatching (default 1)
c@ options
c	Task enrichment options. Minimum match of all keywords is active.
c
c	"abut" means don't leave any white space between subplots.  The
c	  default is to leave a little bit between subplots, and 
c	  OPTIONS=GAPS leaves a lot of space and labels eacg subplot
c	  separately.
c	"beamAB", where "A" is one of "b" or "t" and 
c	                "B" is one of "l" or "r"
c	  means draw the beam FWHM on the plot in the corner indicated
c	  by the "AB" location. This option is deprecated: use the
c         keyword "beamtyp" instead.
c       "blacklab" means that, if the device is white-background, draw
c         the axis labels in black. Default is red. 
c	"conlabel" means label the contour values on the actual contours.
c	  The PGPLOT routine that does this is not very bright. You will
c	  probably get too many labels.  If you bin the image up with
c	  keyword XYBIN, say, by a factor of 2, you will get about 1/2
c	  as many labels.   If desperate use the overlay facility 
c	  (keyword OLAY) to manually label contours.
c	"fiddle" means enter a routine to allow you to interactively change
c	  the display lookup table.  You can cycle through a variety of
c	  colour lookup tables, as well as alter a linear transfer function
c	  by the cursor location, or by selecting predefined transfer 
c	  functions (linear, square root, logarithmic, histogram equalization)
c	  
c	  For hard copy devices (e.g. postscript), a keyboard driven
c	  fiddle is offered; you can cycle through different colour tables
c	  and invoke the predefined transfer functions, but the linear
c	  fiddler is not available.   Note that if you are using "cgdisp"
c	  from a script, so that interactive fiddling is not appropriate,
c	  you can use the "range" keyword to specify the transfer
c	  function and colour lookup tables.
c	"full" means do full plot annotation with contour levels, pixel
c	  displa range, file names, reference values, etc.  Otherwise 
c	  more room for the plot is available. 
c	"gaps" means leave large gaps between subplots and individually
c	  label the axes of each subplot. By default, the subplots will 
c	  have a small amount of white space between each subplot and 
c	  they will only be labelled around the borders of the full page.  
c	  See also OPTIONS=ABUT to eliminate the small amount of white space.
c	"grid" means draw a coordinate grid on the plot rather than just ticks
c	"mirror" causes all specified contour levels for all images
c	  to be multiplied by -1 and added to the list of contours
c	"nodistort" means that angularly-defined overlays do not distort 
c	  with the coordinate grid.  If you are displaying a large area of 
c	  the sky, such that the non-linearities in the coordinate system 
c	  can be seen, then by default, the overlays (keyword OLAY) will 
c	  distort with the coordinate grid if you are using angular units 
c	  for the overlay locations and half sizes.  Thus star overlays
c	  will rotate and stretch, circles will distort similarly. 
c	  Overlays given in non-angular units will always be undistorted.
c	"noepoch" means don't write the epoch value into the axis labels
c	"noerase" means don't erase a rectangle into which the "3-axis"
c	  values and the overlay ID strings are written.
c	"nofirst" means don't write the first x-axis label on any subplots
c	  except for the left-most one. This may avoid label overwrite.
c	"relax" means issue warnings when image axis descriptors are
c	  inconsistent (e.g. different pixel increments) instead
c	  of a fatal error.  Use at your peril.
c	"rot90" rotates vectors by an extra 90 degrees.  Useful
c	  to convert E-vectors into B-vectors
c	"signs"  Normally, when plotting vectors, CGDISP assumes that
c	  North is up and East to the left.  If OPTIONS=SIGNS, then
c	  it assumes that E and N are in the direction of increasing
c	  X and Y.
c	"single" means that when you have selected OPTIONS=FIDDLE and you
c	  you have more than one subplot per page, activate the fiddle
c	  option after each subplot rather than the default, which is
c	  to fiddle only at the end.  In the latter case, the histogram
c	  equalization, if invoked, will have been computed with the 
c	  image in the last subplot only.
c	"solneg1" means make negative contours solid and positive 
c	  contours dashed for the first contour image. The default, 
c	  and usual convention is the reverse.
c	"solneg2" SOLNEG1 for the second contour image.
c	"solneg3" SOLNEG1 for the third contour image.
c	"trlab" means label the top and right axes as well as the 
c	  bottom and left ones.  This can be useful when non-linear 
c	  coordinate variation across the field makes the ticks misaligned
c	"unequal" means draw plots with unequal scales in x and y
c	  so that the plot surface is maximally filled.  The default
c	  is for equal scales in x and y.
c	"wedge" means that if you are drawing a pixel map, also draw
c	  and label a wedge to the right of the plot, showing the map 
c	  of intensity to colour.
c	"3pixel" means label each sub-plot with the pixel value of
c	  the third axis.
c	"3value" means label each sub-plot with the appropriate 
c	  value of the third axis (e.g. velocity or frequency for an
c	  xyv ordered cube, position for a vxy ordered cube).
c	  Both "3pixel" and "3value" can appear, and both will be 
c	  written on the plot.  They are the average values when
c	  the third axis is binned up with CHAN.  If the third axis
c	  is not velocity or frequency, the units type for "3VALUE" 
c	  will be chosen to be the complement of any like axis in the 
c	  first 2. E.g., the cube is in vxy order and LABTYP=ABSKMS,ARCSEC 
c	  the units for the "3VALUE" label will be arcsec.  If 
c	  LABTYP=ABSKMS,HMS the "3VALUE" label will be DMS (if the 
c	  third [y] axis is declination).  See also keyword "3format"
c	  where you can input the format for the "3value" labelling.
c@ 3format
c	If you ask for "3value" labelling, this keyword allows you
c	specify the FORTRAN format of the labelling.  I have given
c	up trying to invent a decent algorithm to choose this. Examples
c	are "1pe12.6", or "f5.2" etc   If you leave this blank cgdisp 
c	will try something that you probably won't like.
c@ lines
c 	Up to 6 values.  The line widths for the axes, each contour 
c       image (in the order of TYPE), the vector image, and any overlays.
c	If there are less than 3 contour images or no vector
c	image, the vector image/overlay line widths shift left.
c	Line widths must be integers.
c	Defaults are 1,1,1,1,1,1
c@ break
c	Up to 3 values. The intensity levels for the break between
c	solid and dashed contours for each contour image. 
c	Defaults are 0.0,0.0,0.0
c@ csize
c	Up to 4 values.  Character sizes in units of the PGPLOT default
c	(which is ~ 1/40 of the view surface height) for the plot axis
c	labels, the velocity/channel label, the overlay ID string
c	(if option "write" in OLAY used) label, and the contour
c	value labels (see options=conlab). 
c	Defaults try to choose something sensible.  Use 0.0 to default
c	any particular value. E.g., 1.4, 0, 0, 0.5
c@ scale
c	Up to 2 values.  Scales in natural axis units/mm with which to plot
c	in the 	x and y directions.  For example, if the increments 
c	per pixel are in radians, then this number would be radians/mm
c	(note that for RA axes you give radians on the sky per mm).
c	Although this choice of unit may be cumbersome, it makes no 
c	assumptions about the axis type, so is more flexible.   If you 
c	also chose OPTIONS=EQUAL then one of your scales, if you set 
c	both and differently, would be over-ruled.  If you give only 
c	one value, the second defaults to that.  
c	Defaults choose scales to fill the page optimally. To default 
c	the first but the second, use 0.0,scale(2)
c@ olay
c	The name of a file containing a list of overlay descriptions.
c	Wild card expansion is active and the default is no overlays.
c	
c	Miriad task CGCURS OPTIONS=CURSOR,LOG,CGDISP  can be used to
c	make an overlay file.
c
c	Entries in the overlay file can be white space or comma
c	delimitered or both.  All lines beginning with # are ignored.
c
c	                **** DO NOT USE TABS **** 
c
c	Double quotes " are used below to indicate a string.  The "
c	should not be put in the file.   For all the string parameters
c	discussed below, you can abbreviate them with minimum match.
c
c
c	Each line describes an overlay and should be as follows:
c
c	 ##### The first 5 columns in each line must be
c
c	  1      2       3     4    5        Column
c	 --------------------------------
c	 OFIG  XOTYPE  YOTYPE  ID  WRITE      where
c
c	OFIG is the type of overlay; choose from
c	 "star"    for stars (crosses; give centre and half-sizes)
c	 "circle"  for a filled in circle (give centre and radius)
c	 "ocircle" for an open circle (give centre and radius)
c	 "ellipse" for a filled in ellipse (give centre, half axes and p.a.)
c	 "oellipse for an open ellipse (give centre, half axes and p.a.)
c	 "box"     for boxes (give centre and half-sizes)
c	 "line"    for line segments (give ends)
c	 "clear"   for a see-through overlay -- thus you can write the
c	           overlay ID string (see below) without the overlay
c        "sym"     for pgplot symbol number (given centre and symbol)
c
c	XOTYPE and YOTYPE  give the units of the overlay location (and 
c	overlay half-sizes) contained in the file for the x- and y-
c	directions, respectively.  Choose from:
c	 "hms", "dms", "arcsec", "arcmin", "absdeg", "reldeg", "abspix",
c	 "relpix", "absnat", "relnat", "absghz", "relghz", 
c	 "abskms", & "relkms"  as described in the keyword LABTYP.  
c	Note that OTYPE does not depend upon what you specified for LABTYP.
c
c	ID is an identifying overlay string which can be optionally
c	written on the overlay; it MUST be in the overlay file whether
c	you write it on the plot or not).  The ID string is written in the
c	corner for "star" and "box", in the centre for "clear", "circle"
c	at the end for "line".  Note that the underscore character "_"
c	is treated a special case and is replaced by a blank before plotting.
c	In this way, you can write several words as the overlay ID; you
c	connect them with underscores in the overlay file, and cgdisp
c	strips them out before plotting.
c
c	WRITE is "yes" or "no" to specify if the overlay ID is to be 
c	written in the overlay figure or not.
c
c
c	 ##### Columns beyond number 5 depend upon OFIG, XOTYPE, and YOTYPE
c
c	 6   7    8   9  10  11  12   Logical column
c	 ---------------------------
c	 X   Y   XS  YS  CS  CE       for OFIG="box" and "star"

c	 X   Y   SY  SS  CS  CE       for OFIG="sym"
c
c	X,Y defines the center of the overlay in the nominated OTYPE
c	coordinate system (X- and Y-OTYPE can be different).  
c	(X1,Y1) & (X2,Y2) are the end points of the line segment in the
c	nominated OTYPE (mixed OTYPEs are supported here too).
c	For %OTYPE = "abspix ", "relpix", "arcsec", "arcmin", "absdeg", 
c	             "reldeg", "absghz", "relghz", "abskms", "relkms", 
c	             "absnat" & "relnat" X,Y,X1,Y1,X2,Y2 are single numbers.
c
c	For %OTYPE = "hms" or "dms", the X and/or Y location is/are replaced
c	by three numbers such as  HH MM SS.S or DD MM SS.S.  Thus if
c	XOTYPE=hms & YOTYPE=dms then the file should have lines like
c
c	  HH MM SS.S   DD MM SS.S   XS   YS  CHAN    for OFIG="box", say
c
c
c	XS, YS are the overlay half-sizes in the following units.
c	%OTYPE = "abspix" and "relpix" in pixels
c	         "hms"    and "dms"    in arcseconds
c	         "arcsec"              in arcseconds
c	         "arcmin"              in arcminutes
c	         "absdeg" and "reldeg" in degrees
c	         "absghz" and "relghz" in GHz
c	         "abskms" and "relkms" in km/s
c	         "absnat" and "relnat" in natural coordinates
c
c	SY is the pgplot symbol to use for "sym"
c
c	SS is the pgplot character height to use for "sym". Default
c       is character height used for overlay string
c
c	R is the radius of circle overlays.  It is in the units given
c	in the above list according to XOTYPE only. 
c
c	R1 and R2 are the ellipse major and minor axes half-widths,
c	both in units according to XOTYPE. PA is the position angle
c	in degrees, positive  N -> E
c
c	CS to CE is the channel range (image planes) on which to put the 
c	overlays.  If you specify only CS than the overlay is put
c	on that channel.  If CS=0 then the overlays are put on all
c	channels. 
c
c	For OFIG="box" and "star", XS, YS are optional.  The defaults
c	are XS=2, YS=XS pixels.   In all cases, CS and CE  are optional

c	#####  The OFFSET line
c
c	At any point in the overlay file, you can include an OFFSET
c	line in the format
c	
c	"OFFSET"   XOFF   YOFF
c
c	where the literal "OFFSET" (without the quotes) must appear
c	as the first thing in the line, followed by X and Y offsets,
c	which are applied to all succeeding overlay file locations.
c	       X = X + XOFF;   Y = Y + YOFF
c	These offsets must be in the same units as the %OTYPE that the
c	succeeding line(s) has(ve).  It is intended so that your overlay
c	locations can be in, say, arcsec relative to some location which
c	is not the reference pixel of the image (which is what CGDISP
c	ultimately wants).   You then specify, with the OFFSET line, the
c	offsets between the reference pixel of the contour/pixel map
c	images and the actual reference location of your overlay locations.
c
c	You can have as many OFFSET lines as you like in the file.  All
c	succeeding lines will apply these offsets until new ones are
c	defined.  If the line does not appear, naturally no additional
c	offsets are added.
c
c	The OFFSET line is not applied to ANY position fields in succeeding
c	lines that have %OTYPEs that are "hms" or "dms".    I am too lazy
c	to code it.
