c= atlod - Convert an RPFITS file into Miriad uv format.
c& rjs
c: data transfer
c+
c       ATLOD is a MIRIAD task, which converts a uv data-set from the
c       RPFITS format to Miriad format.
c@ in
c       Name of the input RPFITS files.  Several names can be given --
c       wildcard expansion is supported.  If a single name is given it
c       can be a raw tape device name (e.g. /dev/nrst0 in UNIX)
c       containing several files.  In this case, see the NFILES keyword
c       below.  There is no default.
c@ out
c       Name of the output Miriad uv data-set.  No default.
c@ ifsel
c       IF number(s) to select.  Default is all IFs.  For example,
c       if you observed with 5 GHz (frequency 1) and 8 GHz (frequency 2)
c       simultaneously, IF 1 would be the 5 GHz data and IF 2 would
c       be the 8 GHz data.  This now also lets you select zoom bands
c       using values greater than 2.  The freq 1 zoom bands come before 
c       the freq 2 ones.
c@ restfreq
c       The rest frequency, in GHz, for line observations.  By default,
c       the value in the RPFITS file is used.  Giving a value for the
c       "restfreq" parameter overrides the RPFITS file value.  If you do
c       set this parameter, you MUST give the same number of values as
c       the number of IFs written out.  A value of 0 is used for a
c       continuum observation.  For example, if you have two IFs, the
c       first of which is HI, and the second is continuum, use
c           restfreq=1.420405752,0
c@ options
c       This gives extra processing options.  Several can be given,
c       separated by comas.
c         'birdie'  For CABB data:
c                   CABB generates self-interference in a number of
c                   channels across the spectrum due to 640 MHz clock
c                   harmonics.  These birdies are fixed in channel
c                   number for each CABB configuration.  The birdie
c                   option currently knows about the 2048x1MHz continuum
c                   mode and flags the affected channels, 100 band edge
c                   channels on each side, and, at 20 and 13cm, the
c                   unusable parts of the spectrum. 
c
c                   For pre-CABB data:
c                   ATCA self-interference can corrupt channels at
c                   integral multiples of 128 MHz.  The birdie option
c                   flags these channels.  Additionally, in continuum
c                   (33 channels/128MHz) mode, the birdie option dicards
c                   every second channel, plus some edge channels.  The
c                   channels discarded are those most likely affected by
c                   the self-interference.  Discarding these channels
c                   does not have a sensitivity penalty, because the
c                   effective channel bandwidth is twice the channel
c                   separation.
c         'reweight' For pre-CABB data: re-weight the lag spectrum to 
c                   eliminate the "Gibbs" phenomena in continuum data
c                   (33 ch/128 MHz); ignored for all other data.
c         'compress' Write output data in compressed format.
c         'noauto'  Discard autocorrelation data.  The default is to
c                   copy the autocorrelation data.
c         'nocross' Discard cross-correlation data.  The default is to
c                   copy the cross correlation data.
c         'relax'   Do not flag visibilities based on SYSCAL
c                   information.  The default is to flag visibilities if
c                   they have not been preceded by a valid SYSCAL
c                   record, or if the the values in the SYSCAL record
c                   look bad.  SYSCAL values are checked for sampler
c                   statistics being within 3% of 17.3%, or 0.5% of
c                   50.0%, that the XY phase is within 10 degrees of its
c                   running median, and that the XY amplitudes are
c                   within 1 Jy or 10% of its running median.  The tests
c                   for xy phase and amplitude are skipped for 3mm data
c                   (as there is no noise calibration signal).
c         'mmrelax' This option is ignored, it is only present for
c                   historical reasons.
c         'unflag'  Save any data that is flagged.  By default ATLOD
c                   discards most data that is flagged.
c         'opcorr'  Correct for atmospheric opacity.  This option is
c                   possible for data measured after October 2003.
c                   Because of the way system temperature is measured at
c                   3mm (an "above atmosphere" measurement), it is not
c                   appropriate for 3mm data.  This option is silently
c                   ignored for 3mm data.  Generally it is only relevant
c                   for 7mm and 12mm observations.  It does no harm (and
c                   negligible good) for longer wavelengths.
c         'samcorr' Correct the pre-Dec93 data for incorrect sampler
c                   statistics.  Since December 1993, sampler
c                   corrections are performed online.  This option is
c                   silently ignored for data measured after December
c                   1993.
c         'xycorr'  Apply the on-line measurements of the XY phase.
c                   This option is silently ignored for 3mm data
c                   measured before October 2007.
c         'hanning' Hanning smooth spectra and drop every other channel
c                   This option is ignored for 128-MHz, 33-channel data.
c         'bary'    Use the barycentre as the velocity rest frame.  The
c                   default is to use the LSR frame.
c         'noif'    Do not map the simultaneous IFs to the IF axis.
c                   By default ATLOD attempts to map the simultaneous
c                   frequencies to the IF axis.  This will not be
c                   possible if there are a different number of
c                   polarisations in the different IFs.
c         'nopflag' If at least one polarisation of a set of 2 or 4
c                   polarimetric spectra are bad, ATLOD normally flags
c                   all of the polarisations.  Option nopflag changes
c                   this so that only the nominally bad spectrum is
c                   flagged.
c         'hires'   Treat bin data as measurements in the high time
c                   resolution mode.  The output dataset contains no
c                   bins, but instead appears as data measured with
c                   small cycle times.
c         'pmps'    Undo `poor man's phase switching'.  This is an
c                   obscure option that you should not generally use.
c         'single'  Assume input is a single dish RPFITS file (from
c                   Parkes or Mopra).  This is usually used together
c                   with option 'relax'.
c         'caldata' Save visibilities associated with certain system
c                   calibrations.  Currently this consists of reference
c                   pointing calibration and "paddle" measurements.
c         'nocacal' Flag data that atlod suspects is taken during a
c                   CACAL scan.  There is potential for error in atlod
c                   determining which data are and are not part of a
c                   cacal scan.  Use this with caution.
c         'nopol'   Discard data that is not "parallel hand" Stokes
c                   type.
c         'rfiflag' Flag channels at frequencies that are known to be
c                   bad.  This uses the file rfiflag.txt in the current
c                   directory or the default version in MIRCAT.  The
c                   file should contain 2 frequencies per line, the
c                   lower and upper end of the rfi in MHz.  Precede
c                   comments with a '#'.
c@ nfiles
c       This gives one or two numbers, being the number of files to
c       skip, followed by the number of files to process.  This is only
c       useful when the input is a tape device containing multiple
c       files.  The default is 0,1 (i.e. skip none, process 1 file).
c
c       NOTE: Using this feature to skip many files on a tape is VERY
c       inefficient.  It is far faster to skip using operating system
c       commands.  When doing this, however, you should be aware is that
c       every RPFITS files consists of 3 tape files.  Thus you will want
c       to skip three times as many tape files as RPFITS files.  For
c       example, in UNIX, to skip 10 RPFITS files, use
c                   mt -f /dev/nrst0 fsf 30
c@ nscans
c       This gives one or two numbers, being the number of scans to
c       skip, followed by the number of scans to process.  NOTE: This
c       applies to all files read.  The default is to skip none and
c       process all scans.

c
c  Program Structure:
c    Miriad atlod can be divided into three rough levels. The high level
c    gets input parameters, opens the output, and tells the appropriate
c    subroutines what to do.
c
c    The RP layer is the layer which interacts with RPFITSIN and the
c    RPFITS common.  Its "dispatch" routine (RPDISP) waits for an
c    integration to start, and then calls the Poke routines in the
c    order:
c       Poke1st (start an integration)
c       PokeMisc,PokeAnt,PokeIF,PokeSrc (if these have changed)
c       PokeSC (syscal info), PokeData (corr data).
c       PokeFlsh (finish the integration)
c    Prior to calling the Poke routines, RPDISP discards unneeded
c    data and maps the selected frequencies notional IFs.
c    The RP layer is in charge of data selection.
c
c    The Poke layer buffers up information about the current
c    integration, and flushes it to the output file when all is ready.
c    The Poke layer is in charge of any massaging that needs to be done
c    to the data (e.g. hanning smoothing, sampler correction).
