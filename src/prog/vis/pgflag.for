c     PGFLAG is a MIRIAD task that allows interactive baseline
c     editing of a UV data set. It is much like the MIRIAD task
c     TVFLAG, but it uses the PGPLOT display devices instead of
c     of the TV devices, which should make it more accessible.
c
c     When this program is run, the first selectable baseline is
c     displayed as a greyscale waterfall plot. The x-axis is
c     labelled as channel number (increasing to the right), while
c     the y-axis represents time (later is toward the top of the
c     plot). The colour intensity represents the amplitude or phase
c     (depending on the value of the keyword ``mode'') of the
c     visibility. At the very right and bottom edges of the plot
c     are averages of the data over all the channels and times
c     respectively. Between the right-hand average and the main
c     plot is a colour wedge that shows the amplitude/phase scaling.
c     At the top of the plot is a box with information about the
c     baseline that is being viewed, the last taken measurement,
c     and a guide to the commonly required action keys.
c
c     The user may edit the data by selecting a range of channels
c     and times with the mouse, and then flagging or unflagging
c     them. Selecting a range of channels and times is done by
c     selecting two points - one with the left mouse button and
c     one with the right mouse button - that bound the desired
c     range. When a selection is made with either the left mouse
c     button or the right mouse button, a green point will be
c     placed on the screen at the selected location. If both a
c     left mouse selection and a right mouse selection have been
c     made, a green box will be displayed that will have the two
c     selected points as opposite corners. Selecting another point
c     with either the left mouse button or the right mouse button
c     will move the appropriate corner of the box to form a new
c     selection.
c
c     To act upon this selection, or the plot itself, the user
c     should press one of the following keys while the cursor is
c     inside the main plot area:
c
c     Exiting PGFLAG:
c       a                Abort the editing procedure and quit
c                        PGFLAG immediately without applying
c                        any flags.
c       q                Apply any flagging that was requested
c                        and then exit PGFLAG.
c
c     Editing data:
c       f                Flag the selected range of data on the
c                        currently displayed baseline only.
c       F                Flag the selected range of data on all
c                        the selectable baselines.
c       g                Unflag the selected range of data on the
c                        currently displayed baseline only.
c       G                Unflag the selected range of data on all
c                        the selectable baselines.
c       u                Undo the last flagging action - if the
c                        last flagging action was an undo of a
c                        previous flagging action, then the effect
c                        will be to redo the flagging.
c       1                Flag the selected range of data on all
c                        baselines A-n formed with the currently
c                        displayed antenna A.
c       !                Unflag the selected range of data on all
c                        baselines A-n formed with the currently
c                        displayed antenna A.
c       2                Flag the selected range of data on all
c                        baselines n-B formed with the currently
c                        displayed antenna B.
c       @                Unflag the selected range of data on all
c                        baselines n-B formed with the currently
c                        displayed antenna B.
c       v                Flag all visibilities that have values
c                        greater than the current maximum on the
c                        scale on the displayed baseline, for this
c                        baseline only.
c       V                Flag all visibilities that have values
c                        greater than the current maximum on the
c                        scale on the displayed baseline, for all
c                        baselines.
c       rr               Remove all current user-specified flags
c                        on this baseline; r must be pressed twice
c                        in a row for safety as this procedure
c                        cannot be undone.
c       RR               Remove all current user-specified flags
c                        on all baselines; R must be pressed twice
c                        in a row for safety as this procedure
c                        cannot be undone.

c                        the selected region cover the entire plot,
c                        and display green arrows on the sides of
c                        the plot to indicate available scrolling
c                        directions.
c       Z                Unzoom to show all the available data.

c                        on the plot.
c       L                Move the plot right by the range shown on the
c                        plot.
c       n                Display the next selectable baseline in the
c                        main plot, leaving the selection and zoom
c                        as is.
c       p                Display the previous selectable baseline in
c                        the main plot, leaving the selection and
c                        zoom as is.
c       x                Subtract the average channel value from each
c                        channel value in the main plot. Pressing this
c                        key again adds back the average channel value
c                        to each channel value. When the channel average
c                        is being subtracted, the channel average box
c                        at the bottom of the plot will be outlined in
c                        red, otherwise it will be outlined in white.
c       d                Subtract the average time value from each
c                        time value in the main plot. Pressing this
c                        key again adds back the average time value to
c                        each time value. When the time average is being
c                        subtracted, the time average box at the right
c                        of the plot will be outlined in red, otherwise
c                        it will be outlined in white.
c       ,                Fiddle the amplitude scale; press this key
c                        then click the left mouse button in the colour
c                        wedge to set the maximum value, or the right
c                        mouse button to set the minimum value.
c       .                Reset the user-set colour amplitude scale.
c       [                Enable switch to use only the currently
c                        displayed points when deciding the colour
c                        amplitude scale.
c       ]                Set the colour amplitude scale from the current
c                        selection region.
c       ;                Lock the colour amplitude scale until it is
c                        reset or fiddled.
c
c     Displaying information:
c       m                Display information about the sample
c                        underneath the cursor, including the channel
c                        number (and associated frequency), the
c                        time, and the amplitude (or phase depending
c                        on the ``mode'' setting); all this information
c                        is shown at the top left of the plot in the red
c                        box.
c       spacebar         Does the same thing as 'm', except it will show
c                        the currently displayed value, which will be
c                        different from the value displayed by 'm' if
c                        the averages have been subtracted from the
c                        display.
c       M                Locate the sample with the maximum value on
c                        the currently displayed baseline, and print
c                        information about it into the controlling
c                        terminal. Pressing it twice in succession will
c                        make PGFLAG create a selection region of 20
c                        chans and 20 times centred on this sample.
c       P                Display the current selection on the secondary
c                        plot device as a spectrum. This command will
c                        work only if device2 is specified.
c
c@ vis
c     Input visibility dataset to be flagged. No default.
c@ line
c     This is the normal linetype specification. See the help on
c     "line" for more information. The default is all channels.
c@ select
c     This selects which visibilities to be used. Default is all
c     visibilities. See the Users Guide for information about how
c     to specify uv data selection.
c     Default is all data
c@ stokes
c     Select Stokes parameter(s) or polarization(s) from:
c       xx, yy, xy, yx,  i, q, u, v,
c       rr, ll, rl, lr
c     Default is all polarizations or Stokes parameters present
c@ device
c     PGPLOT plot device/type, which must be interactive. No default.
c@ device2
c     PGPLOT plot device/type, which must be interactive. This optional
c     plot device will be used to display spectra from the selected
c     region, if requested.
c@ mode
c     Display ``amplitude'' or ``phase''. By default, ``amplitude''
c     is selected. For mode=``phase'', the phase is in degrees.
c@ options
c     Task enrichment parameters. Several can be given, separated by
c     commas. Minimum match is used. Possible values are:
c       selgen  Generate a file appropriate for selecting the bad data
c               (via a 'select' keyword). The output is two text files
c               called 'blflag_flag.select' (for flagging operations),
c               and 'blflag_unflag.select' (for unflagging operations).
c               Unfortunately, since 'select' does not support the use
c               of a 'channel' selection, this option is of limited use,
c               but is supplied in case time-based selection is all that
c               is required.
c       nosrc   Do not cause a break in the display when the source
c               changes. Normally PGFLAG puts a gap in the display
c               whenever the source changes.
c       noapply Do not apply the flagging.
c     The following options can be used to disable calibration.
c       nocal   Do not apply antenna gain calibration.
c       nopass  Do not apply bandpass correction.
c       nopol   Do not apply polarisation leakage correction.

c  History:
c    jbs 21Sep09  Original version. Copying blflag/tvflag.
c    jbs 30Sep09  First released version. Compiles without any warnings
c                 when the -Wall option is passed to gfortran. Comments
c                 for some subroutines are complete, but most still lack
c                 MIRIAD-compliant commenting. The doc-type header
c                 comments are present however. All desired features are
c                 implemented, but it seems that the "nosrc" option does
c                 not work.
c    jbs 02Oct09  Changed I0 format codes to I3 (or I6), as g77 does not
c                 like automatic width settings. Add the 'x' and 'd'
c                 average subtraction functionality.
c    jbs 06Oct09  Added colour amplitude scaling fiddle commands:
c                 , . [ ] ;
c                 Made PGFLAG ask whether quitting/aborting is really
c                 what the user wants to do.
c                 Fixed bug with flagging time sample before desired
c                 time sample.
c                 Made a few consistency checks so PGPLOT doesn't
c                 complain about bad ranges.
c    jbs 07Oct09  Fixed bug that caused too many flags to be applied to
c                 the data. Correctly accounts for and displays the
c                 number of good/bad flags before and after flagging,
c                 and the number of flags changed. Changed internal
c                 baseline flagging representation to allow for antenna
c                 based flagging. Implemented antenna based flagging.
c                 Implement throw-away flags option for this baseline
c                 and all baselines. (version 1.3)
c    jbs 08Oct09  Fixed bug that stopped PGFLAG from reversing through
c                 baselines that were present but completely flagged.
c                 Fixed date calculation issues as previous version
c                 was reporting data as day before. Fixed bug where
c                 flagging was not applied as the last time sample to
c                 be flagged was outside the range of the known time
c                 samples.
c    jbs 09Nov09  Added 'spacebar' function to make a measurement of
c                 the currently displayed value, leaving 'm' to display
c                 the original value. Changed some documentation based
c                 on suggestions from Vince. PGFLAG now plots a red
c                 box below the area of the top region that the
c                 measurements are printed in. Can now use HJKL to move
c                 zoom window faster. Changed max value finder key to
c                 'M', and made it print out actual time instead of
c                 time sample number. Average boxes are now recomputed
c                 and display the average of what is shown instead of
c                 only the average of the original array, so they
c                 update when the averages are subtracted. The box
c                 around each average is drawn in red whenever the
c                 average in that direction is subtracted. Fixed a
c                 bug that would cause the measured values (with
c                 spacebar) to revert to the original values after
c                 a few keypresses. The colour wedge now gets outlined
c                 in light-blue after the ',' key is pressed, and in
c                 purple if the scale has been fiddled, or white if it
c                 has not been. Fix problem with incorrect flag numbers
c                 being printed if we quit with no flagging to apply.
c                 Added action on '?' to print out info about the number
c                 of flagging actions made in total and on the current
c                 baseline.
c                 (version 1.4)
c    vjm 09Dec09  Merge to mainline. Remove the eol characters. Add RCS
c                 tags.
c    jbs 07Oct10  Fix bug that stopped single-scan mosaics from being
c                 displayed, since each source change creates a scan
c                 break (represented internally by -2), making it
c                 impossible to find an intermediate time sample; now
c                 it works, but looks stupid - can make it look better
c                 by using 'options=nosrc'. Made a number of changes
c                 to allow selection of the first and last channels and
c                 times.
c    jbs 21Feb11  Fix bug that wouldn't allow user to make measurements
c                 of, or flag, visibilities that were from the day
c                 after the starting date of the plot. Added the 'V' and
c                 'v' commands to flag bright pixels.
c    jbs 22Feb11  Fix bug in the way flagging regions were extended near
c                 time break boundaries. Made a common task to handle
c                 conversion to a string representation of the time.
c                 Now possible to plot an average spectrum of the
c                 selected region on another specified PGPLOT device.
