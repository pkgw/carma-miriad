\chapter{Program Development}
Programs are developed in the usual manner, making calls to the \miriad\
subroutine library. It may be convenient to pass code through the RATTY
preprocessor before compiling. RATTY
preprocesses a few language extensions into standard Fortran, and flags a few
bad programming practises. When linking, the \miriad\ object library, libmir,
is used.

\section{General Programming Conventions}
\miriad\ tasks should be written in Fortran-77.
Though you should program in standard FORTRAN, two
extensions will generally be needed by the programmer. Firstly \miriad\
uses both upper and lower case character strings (Fortran-77 strictly
supports only upper case characters. However almost all compilers
support both upper and lower case, and it would be a reasonably
simple preprocessing job to convert all of \miriad\ to a strictly
upper case system if the need ever arises). Generally \miriad\ routines
are case-sensitive, with lower case being preferred.

Secondly \miriad\ tasks should use the {\tt maxdim.h} include file where
appropriate. This include file
defines a parameter, {\tt maxdim}, which gives the maximum image dimension
that a task should be prepared to accept. Currently this is set to
4096, but by using {\tt maxdim} to define needed storage, it should
be reasonably easy to rebuild all \miriad\ tasks to handle larger images.
The include file also defines a parameter {\tt maxbuf}, which is a guide
to the maximum amount of internal data storage that a program should contain.

Despite the encouragement to use this include file, programmers are generally
discouraged
from using include files and common blocks. This is far from a strict rule.
Avoid them if you can.

See Chapter~\ref{ch:utilities} for a description of some utilities which
simplify the development of code.

\section{In-Line Documentation}
Documentation for \miriad\ tasks and subroutines is included as comments
within the body of the code (delimited by special ``directives''). This
documentation is stripped out by the \verb+doc+ program to produce a
\verb+.doc+ file. This \verb+.doc+ file is then used by the on-line
help facilities and the manual generation utilities.

This documentation should be at the head of the source code.  In FORTRAN
notation, the documentation ``directives'' are:
{\begin{verbatim}
c=  [routine name] [one-line description]   (for programs)
c*  [routine name] [one-line description]   (for subroutines)
c&  programmer ID
c:  comma-separated list of categories
c+
c   start of multi-line description block
c@  keyword                                 (for tasks)
c   multi-line keyword description          (for tasks)
c<  standard keyword                        (for tasks - deprecated form)
c-- 
\end{verbatim}}
For FORTRAN, comment lines can begin with either an uppercase or a 
lowercase {\tt c}. In-line documentation in C is analogous, except that
comment lines begin with a {\tt /*}. Note also that once a
{\tt /*} is entered, everything until the next {\tt */} is considered
a comment; it is the programmer's responsibility to determine where to
place the {\tt */}.

The entries in the comma-separated list of categories should be:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\multicolumn{4}{l}{For executables:}\\

\subsection*{A Program Example}

By way of illustration, below is the in-code documentation for
\miriad\ task \task{varplot} which uses the ``directives'' noted previously.
{\small\begin{verbatim}
c= varplot - Plot uv variables
c& lgm
c: uv analysis, plotting
c+
c       VARPLOT makes X,Y plots selected variables from a uv data set.
c       Only integer, real, and double precision variables maybe plotted.
c       When curser is in the plot window, the following keys are active:
c          X - expand window in X to give one column of plots
c          Y - expand window in Y to give one row of plots
c          Z - expand window in both X and Y to show only one plot
c          N - step to "next" plot in x or y or both depending on expansion
c@ vis
c       Miriad uv data-set. No default.
c@ device
c       PGPLOT plotting device. No default.
c@ xaxis
c       Name of variable to be plotted along x-axis. Default is ut time.
c@ yaxis
c       Name of variable to be plotted along y-axis. No default.
c@ multi
c       Make multiple plots or a single plot? Yes yields multiple plots,
c       No yields a single plot with multiple lines as needed. Default
c       is yes.
c@ compr
c       Compress number of x or y variables to be plotted by averaging
c       over spectral windows. Currently only SYSTEMP can be averaged.
c--
\end{verbatim}}
The task's name is ``varplot'', its one-line description is ``Plot uv
variables'', the responsible programmer is ``lgm'', and the program is
categorized as both a ``uv analysis'' program and a ``plotting'' program.
It has a general description (the text following the {\tt c+} line), and
it has 6 keywords that the user may set:  ``vis'', ``device'',
``xaxis'', ``yaxis'', ``multi'',
and ``compr''.

\subsection*{A Subroutine Example}

By way of illustration, below is the in-code documentation for
\miriad\ subroutine axistype, which uses the ``directives'' noted previously.
{\small\begin{verbatim}
c* Axistype - Find the axis label and plane value in user friendly units
c& mchw
c: plotting
c+
        subroutine AxisType(lIn,axis,plane,ctype,label,value,units)
c
        implicit none
        integer lIn,axis,plane
        character ctype*9,label*13,units*13
        double precision value
c
c Find the axis label and plane value in user friendly units.
c
c  Inputs:
c    lIn        The handle of the image.
c    axis       The image axis.
c    plane      The image plane along this axis.
c  Output:
c    ctype      The official ctype for the input axis.
c    label      A nice label for this axis.
c    value      The value at the plane along this axis.
c    units      User friendly units for this axis.
c--
\end{verbatim}}
Note that the programmer has woven executable code into the documentation
(the lines that are not commented out):  anything between the {\tt c+} and
the {\tt c--} is considered to be part of the documentation, even though
the lines are actually part of the subroutine code itself.

A subroutine source code file (or a program source code file) may contain
multiple subroutines, each documented as above.

\section{Code History}
All source code files should contain comments (near the start of the file)
describing the creation and modification history.  This is quite important
in the \miriad\ development environment, where programs are spread
across many computers and programmers are separated by many miles.

Below are typical history comments (taken from the ``key'' routines,
subroutine key.for):
{\small\begin{verbatim}
c************************************************************************
c  The key routines provide keyword-oriented access to the command line.
c
c  History:
c    rjs    6jun87    Original version.
c    bs     7oct88    Converted it to use iargc and getarg. Added -f flag.
c    rjs    8sep89    Improved documentation.
c    nebk  10sep89    Added mkeyr.  I think rjs will not like it (Too right!).
c    rjs   19oct89    Major rewrite to handle @ files.
c    rjs   15nov89    Added keyf routine, and did the rework needed to support
c                     this. Added mkeyf. Modified mkeyr.
c    pjt   26mar90    Added mkeya. like mkeyr (again, bobs will not like this)
c    pjt   10apr90    some more verbose bug calls.
c    rjs   23apr90    Made pjt's last changes into standard FORTRAN (so the
c                     Cray will accept it).
c    pjt   10may90    Make it remember the programname in keyini (se key.h)
c                     for bug calls - introduced progname
c    rjs   22oct90    Check for buffer overflow in keyini.
c    pjt   21jan90    Added mkeyi, variable index is now idx, exp is expd
c************************************************************************
\end{verbatim}}

\section{Task Version Identification}
The first executable statement of a program should be to print out a version
identification. The following is typical:
\begin{verbatim}
c****************************************************************
       program Clean
          .
          .
          .
       character version*(*)
       parameter(version='Clean: version 1.0 26-jan-90')
          .
          .
          .
       call output(version)
\end{verbatim}
This gives a version and the date when the task {\tt CLEAN} was last modified.
Additionally, this version identification should be included
in any history generated by the task.

\newchapter
\chapter{\miriad\ Subroutine Library}
\section{Task Parameters}\index{command-line}\index{user-input}
\begin{verbatim}

     subroutine keyini
     subroutine keyr(keyword,value,default)
     subroutine keyd(keyword,value,default)
     subroutine keyi(keyword,value,default)
     subroutine keyl(keyword,value,default)
     subroutine keya(keyword,value,default)
     subroutine keyf(keyword,value,default)
     subroutine mkeyr(keyword,values,nmax,n)
     subroutine mkeyi(keyword,values,nmax,n)
     subroutine mkeya(keyword,values,nmax,n)
     subroutine mkeyf(keyword,values,nmax,n)
     logical function keyprsnt(keyword)
     subroutine keyfin

\end{verbatim}
The {\tt key} routines are used to get task parameters, which describe the
processing that is to be performed.
Typically the {\tt key} routines
will be called in the first few lines of the task, and never called
again. All checking for the validity of the parameters should be
carried out at this time.

{\tt Keyini} initializes the {\tt key} routines, and must be the first
routine called. Similarly {\tt keyfin} tidies up, and closes down.
{\tt Keyr, keyd, keyi, keyl} and {\tt keya} return the value of a task parameter
from the user. Their inputs are {\tt keyword} (a character string) and
{\tt default}, the default value for the parameter. {\em The
keyword must be in lower case.} The task
parameter is returned in {\tt value}.
 {\tt Keyi}, {\tt keyr}, {\tt keyl}, {\tt keyd} and {\tt keya} are used
for integer, real, logical, double precision  and character values respectively.
Only one value is returned at a time.
The {\tt keyf} routine is like {\tt keya}, except that the string entered
by the user is treated as a file name, and wildcard expansion is performed.
The {\tt key} routines can be called several times, giving the same
keyword, and each successive call will get the next value associated
with the keyword.

For example, if TRC is defined by the user as:
\begin{verbatim}

      % TRC = 45,50

\end{verbatim}
then the code:
\begin{verbatim}

     call keyi('trc',n1,1)
     call keyi('trc',n2,1)

\end{verbatim}
will return the values 45 and 50 to {\tt n1} and {\tt n2} respectively.

These routines always return a value, even if it is only the default
value. To determine if a parameter was actually set by the use, the
{\tt keyprsnt} routine can be called. This returns {\tt .true.} if a value for
the keyword still remains. An alternate way to test if a value is still
present is to use a default which is 
clearly illegal (e.g. a blank string for a file name, or 0 for a
pixel index).

The {\tt mkey} routine return all values entered by the user for that
particular keyword where all the values of the keyword are of the same
data type. For these routines {\tt values} is an array of {\tt nmax}
elements. The number of values returned (which may be zero) is given
by {\tt n}.

\section{Error Handling}\index{error-handling}
Many \miriad\ routines perform error checking internally, and bomb out if an
error is detected. Other \miriad\ routines pass back a status value (generally
the last subroutine argument). A status value of zero indicates success,
-1 indicates end-of-file, and a positive value indicates some other error
(what the positive values indicate is system dependent). Two routines can
be called to indicate an error:
\begin{verbatim}

      subroutine bug(severity,text)
      subroutine bugno(severity,number)

\end{verbatim}
Here {\tt severity} is a single character, being either {\tt 'w', 'e'} or
{\tt 'f'}, meaning warning, error and fatal respectively. When {\tt bug}
or {\tt bugno}
is called with a fatal error, it will not return. Rather it will
cause the task to exit. For routine {\tt bug}, {\tt text} is a character
string describing the error. For routine {\tt bugno}, {\tt number} is a
status value, returned by a \miriad\ routine.

\section{Text I/O}\index{text-i/o}
Though standard Fortran-77 routines would appear to be adequate for text i/o,
there are invariably minor differences between systems, mainly related to
carriage control. Additionally placing them in a module of routines forces
the programmer to follow the `handle' convention.
\begin{verbatim}

      subroutine output(text)
      subroutine txtopen(handle,name,status,iostat)
      subroutine txtread(handle,text,length,iostat)
      subroutine txtwrite(handle,text,length,iostat)
      subroutine txtclose(handle)

\end{verbatim}
{\tt Output} prints {\tt text} (a character string) on the users terminal.

{\tt Txtopen} opens a text file (passing back a handle) with name {\tt name}.
{\tt Status} can be either {\tt 'old'} or {\tt 'new'}. When opening a new
file, any old files which exist with the same name may be deleted.
{\tt Txtread} and {\tt txtwrite} read and write a character string, {\tt text},
of {\tt length} characters. {\tt Length} is passed back from {\tt txtread},
whereas it is passed into {\tt txtwrite}. It may be zero in either case.
All these routines return an i/o status variable, {\tt iostat}.

{\tt Txtclose} closes the file.

\section{General Data Set Handling}\index{data-sets}
\miriad\ makes few distinctions between what some systems (e.g. GIPSY,
AIPS and FITS) call ``data'' and ``header''.
Instead a data ``file'' (usually called a data set in this
document) consists of a collection of items. Some
items are small (a few bytes) whereas others are large (e.g. the collection
of pixels in an image). All items are accessed by their name (a lower case
string of up to 8 alphanumeric characters. Underscore and dollar
characters are to be avoided). Convention dictates the names
assigned to the various items within a data set. For example, the
item name ``image'' is always used to store the pixel data of an image, 
``naxis'' is the number of dimensions in an image, and ``naxis1'' is
the number of pixels along the first axis of an image. New
sorts of data items can be invented as the need arises.

What would be conventionally call header variables, are stored as small items.
The naming convention is close to the FITS standard (though the names are
lower case).

The following sections describe routines that in some way package together
several calls to the lower level i/o routines. Their first argument is
a ``handle'' returned by one of the open routines.

\section{UV Data Sets}\index{uv-data}
\subsection{General}
At the very least, a uv data set can be viewed as a sequence of 
correlation
records, with associated u and v coordinates, time and baseline number.
Associated with each correlation is a flag, indicating whether the
correlation is believed to be good or bad.

The \miriad\ uv data structure required a more general structure. Unfortunately
this is more complicated and somewhat cumbersome for simple cases.
A uv data set can be viewed as an ordered (generally time ordered) stream of
named records or ``variables''. There are markers in this data stream, to
indicate when
several variables change ``simultaneously'' (i.e. they correspond to the
same time). Each variable
consists of an array of values, the type of which can be either integer, real
or double precision, etc. Correlation data, u and v coordinates,
time and baseline numbers are specific examples of variables.
Because of the special nature of these variables, special routines are
available to simplify accessing them. A list of the variables
that may be present in a uv data set is given in Appendix I.

In addition to this variable stream, a uv file will contain a file giving
flagging information.

It should be noted that ``variables'' and ``items''
are quite distinct. For a particular data set, variables vary, or at least may
vary,
whereas data items are fixed. The notion of variables is unique to uv data sets,
whereas all \miriad\ data sets are composed of data items. The stream of
uv variables is implemented as three data items, called {\tt visdata},
{\tt vartable} and {\tt flags}.

There is a ``miriad'' of uv routines.
The routines used to access and manipulate a uv data set are given in the
following table.
\begin{table}
\begin{verbatim}

      subroutine uvopen(tno,dataname,status)
      subroutine uvread(tno,preamble,data,flags,n,nread)
      subroutine uvflgwr(tno,flags)
      subroutine uvwrite(tno,preamble,data,flags,n)
      subroutine uvclose(tno)
      subroutine uvrewind(tno)

      subroutine uvwread(tno,data,flags,n,nread)
      subroutine uvwwrite(tno,data,flags,n)

      subroutine uvgetvra(tno,varname,data)
      subroutine uvgetvri(tno,varname,data,n)
      subroutine uvgetvrr(tno,varname,data,n)
      subroutine uvgetvrd(tno,varname,data,n)
      subroutine uvgetvrc(tno,varname,data,n)

      subroutine uvrdvra(tno,varname,data,default)
      subroutine uvrdvri(tno,varname,data,default)
      subroutine uvrdvrr(tno,varname,data,default)
      subroutine uvrdvrd(tno,varname,data,default)
      subroutine uvrdvrc(tno,varname,data,default)

      subroutine uvprobvr(tno,varname,type,length,update)

      subroutine uvputvra(tno,varname,data)
      subroutine uvputvri(tno,varname,data,n)
      subroutine uvputvrr(tno,varname,data,n)
      subroutine uvputvrd(tno,varname,data,n)
      subroutine uvputvrc(tno,varname,data,n)

      subroutine uvtrack(tno,varname,switches)
      integer function uvscan(tno,varname)
      logical function uvupdate(tno)
      subroutine uvmark(tno,onoff)
      subroutine uvcopyvr(tin,tout)
      subroutine uvnext(tno)

      subroutine uvset(tno,object,type,n,p1,p2,p3)
      subroutine uvselect(tno,object,p1,p2,flag)
      subroutine uvinfo(tno,object,data)
\end{verbatim}
\caption{UV Data Subroutines}
\end{table}

\subsection{Open, Close and Rewind}
The routine {\tt uvopen} opens a uv data set and readies it for access.
Here {\tt dataname} is a string giving the data set's name. {\tt Status} can
be either {\tt 'old'} or {\tt 'new'}, depending whether an old data set is
being read, or a new data set is being created. {\tt Tno} is an integer
handle passed back by the open routine (and is used for all future access
to the data set). The routine {\tt uvclose} closes the data set.
The routine {\tt uvrewind} positions a uv file at its beginning, and
allows it to be read again.

\subsection{Reading and Writing Visibilities}
The routines {\tt uvread} and {\tt uvwrite} are routines used to read and
write the correlation data (and the associated flagging information).
Here {\tt preamble} is an array of four double precision elements, {\tt data}
is an array of {\tt n} 
complex elements, whereas {\tt flags} is an array of {\tt n} logical values.
{\tt Preamble}, {\tt data} and {\tt flags} are output from {\tt uvread},
whereas they are input to {\tt uvwrite}. The four elements of
{\tt preamble} are the u coordinate, v coordinate (measured in nanoseconds),
time (Julian date) and baseline number. The baseline number, $Bl$, is
calculated  as:
\[
Bl = 256 A_1 + A_2
\]
where $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the numbers of the first and second antennae
respectively (antenna numbers vary from 1 to $N_{antenna}$). The array
{\tt data} is used to store the complex correlation data, whereas the logical
values of the array
{\tt flags} indicate whether the corresponding correlation is
deemed good or bad (true or false, respectively). For {\tt uvread}, {\tt n}
limits the number of correlations that can be read; the actual number of
correlations read is passed back as {\tt nread}. {\tt Uvread} can perform
a number of additional processing steps -- see the description of
{\tt uvset} (Section~\ref{sect:uvset}).

The flags of a data file can be modified using the {\tt uvflgwr} subroutine.
When called, the flags associated with the previous call to
{\tt uvread} and {\tt uvwrite} are changed to those values given in the
{\tt flags} array. Using {\tt uvflgwr} when reading a visibility file,
is the method used to develop flagging tasks. Currently {\tt uvflgwr}
has the limitation that the linetype is either `channel' or `wide', and that
the `start' and `width' linetype parameters are 1 (see
Section~\ref{sect:uvset}). Also {\tt uvflgwr}
aborts if no flagging file exists

\subsection{Reading and Writing Continuum Visibilities}
\miriad\ uv datasets can contain both spectral and continuumn visibility
data simultaneously. When both are present, the user/programmer will
normally select which of these data to read, using the {\tt uvset} routine
(see Section~\ref{sect:uvset}). However this allows only one ``linetype'' to be
read and written at a time. The {\tt uvwread} and {\tt uvwwrite} allow
the programmer to read and write the continuum data independently
of the ``linetype''. These routines completely bypass linetype processing.
They should be used only when both a particular linetype, and the continuum
data are required. {\tt Uvwread} should be called after the call to
{\tt uvread}, whereas {\tt uvwwrite} should be called before the call to
{\tt uvwrite}.

The routine {\tt uvwflgwr} is the ``wide'' equivalent of {\tt uvflgwr}.
That is, by calling {\tt uvwflgwr}, you can overwrite the flags associated
with the previous call to 
{\tt uvwread} and {\tt uvwwrite}. Note that {\tt uvwflgwr} aborts if no
flagging file exists.

\subsection{Direct Access to UV Variables}
The main routines to access the variables are the {\tt uvgetvr} and
{\tt uvputvr} routines. These read or write (respectively) an array of
variables of given name ({\tt varname}). The data read or written are
in the array {\tt data} (which can be a character string or an integer, real
or double precision
array, depending on the routine called). Exactly {\tt n} values are
read or written. Except for character strings, it is a fatal error,
when reading, if {\tt n} does not
agree with the actual number of values for the variable). For a character
string, the string is blank padded on a read (no {\tt n} parameter is
needed).

When reading an old data set, the {\tt uvgetvr} routines should not be called
before the first call to {\tt uvread}.
When creating a data set, the initial values for all variables should be
written, by calls to the {\tt uvputvr} routines, before the first call
to the {\tt uvwrite} routine (see Section~\ref{sect:uvnext} for
some enlightenment on this issue).

Often it occurs that we are interested in a variable which has a single
value, but we are not sure if the variable is present in the dataset.
It would be possible to handle this with {\tt uvprobvr}
(Section~\ref{sect:uvprobvr}) and {\tt uvgetvr}.
If the variable is not present, then we would want to use a default value.
The {\tt uvrdvr} routines package these three steps. It returns the
value of the variable, {\tt data}. If the variable is missing from the
data stream, the default value, {\tt default}, is returned. One disadvantage
is that the {\tt uvrdvr} routines only every return a single value (the first
value in a multi-element variable).

The routine {\tt uvread} functions by scanning through the variable streams,
and returns with its results, when the ``correlation data'' (``corr'' or
``wcorr'')
is encountered. If you are not interested in reading the correlation data
(i.e. if you do not intend calling {\tt uvread}),
then the {\tt uvscan} routine can be used to scan through the variable stream
until another variable is encountered. Actually {\tt uvscan} may well read
somewhat past the desired variable, until it has read
all variables which changed simultaneously with the desired one.
{\tt Uvscan} returns 0 is the variable was
successfully found, -1 if an end of file was encountered, or 1 if the
variable was not found. Note that it may not make a great
deal of sense to intermix calls to {\tt uvscan} and {\tt uvread}.

\subsection{Variable Override}
Occassionally it is useful for the user to override the value of a uv variable.
This is especially useful if the value of the variable is both wrong and
important! When uvio opens an old file, for each variable name that is
present in the uv file, it checks if there is a corresponding item with
the same name. If there is, then the value of the item is used to override the
value of the variable. Unfortunately the item must consist of a single
number, and this single number will be copied into each value of the variable
(if the variable consists of several elements).

\subsection{UVNEXT}\label{sect:uvnext}
The uv i/o routines need to know what variables change simultaneously.
all variables that have changes simultaneously. Conversely routine
{\tt uvwrite} assumes that all variables that change simultaneously with
the variables that it writes, have already been written with routine
{\tt uvputvr}. Hence if the programmer is using {\tt uvscan}, {\tt uvread} or
{\tt uvwrite}, then simultaneity is not a concern, as long as variables are
read after {\tt uvscan/uvread}, and written before {\tt uvwrite}. The routine
{\tt uvnext} provides better control, where this is needed. For an input
file, a call to {\tt uvnext} causes the next set of variables (which
change simultaneously) to be read. For an output file, {\tt uvnext} causes
a marker to be written into the data, to indicate that variables written
after the call did not change simultaneously with variables written before
the call.

\subsection{Determining UV Variables and Their Characteristics}
\label{sect:uvprobvr}
Routine {\tt uvprobvr} checks for the existence of a variable, and
returns information about it. The string {\tt varname}, the variable name,
is input. The single character {\tt type} is output, being either
`a', `r', `d', `c', `i', `j' or ` ' (a blank), which indicates (respectively)
that the variable is of type string (ascii),
real, double precision, complex, integer, short integer or (in the case of the
blank) that the variable is not present in the data-set.
The output integer {\tt length}
gives the number of elements in the variable, and the output logical
{\tt update} indicates whether the variable has been updated `recently' (see
Section~\ref{sect:uvchanges}).
Both {\tt length} and {\tt update} have no meaning if the variable is not
present in the data-set. Before a variable is first read,
{\tt length} will be zero, and {\tt update} will be {\tt .false.}.

There is no special routine to return a complete list of the variables
present in a uv data set, however this information is present in the 
item ``{\tt vartable}''. This is a text file with each line
consisting of two fields separated by a blank. The first is the ``type''
(either a, r, d, c, i or j) of the variable, the second is the variables name.
The following section of FORTRAN lists the variables present in a
uv data set.
\begin{verbatim}

       character var*12,name*(?)
       integer iostat,tno,item

       call uvopen(tno,name,'old')
       call haccess(tno,item,'vartable','read',iostat)
       call hreada(item,var,iostat)
       dowhile(iostat.eq.0)
         call output(var(3:10))
         call hreada(item,var,iostat)
       enddo
       call hdaccess(item,iostat)
       call uvclose(tno)

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Keeping Track of UV Variables}
With many variables streaming past, there is a need to keep track on some
particular variables. It would be rather inefficient and laborious to need
to continually call {\tt uvprobvr}, to check on particular variables. The
{\tt uvtrack} routine is used to instruct the uv routines to keep track
of when certain variable changes its value, and to perform special
processing on these variables at a later stage. Typically {\tt uvtrack}
would be called soon after {\tt uvopen}, marking all the variables of
particular interest. The special processing that the uv routines perform
is dictated by the {\tt switches} argument. This is a string,
consisting of several characters, each character representing a particular
processing step to be taken. Currently there are two switches --
{\tt u} and {\tt c}. The {\tt u} switch is used by {\tt uvupdate}, whereas
the {\tt c} switch is used by {\tt uvcopyvr}.

The routine
{\tt uvupdate} returns a {\tt .true.} value if one of the variables, marked
with the {\tt u} switch, has been updated ``recently''
(see Section~\ref{sect:uvchanges}).

The routine {\tt uvcopyvr} copies variables marked with the {\tt c}
switch, from the input dataset (given by {\tt tin}) to the output
dataset (given by {\tt tout}) if they have changed ``recently'' (see
Section~\ref{sect:uvchanges}). You need only
mark the variables in the input dataset.

\subsection{When Do UV Variables Change?}
\label{sect:uvchanges}
A uv variable can change its value in any part of the
uv variable stream. So it can change its value after each call to
{\tt uvread}, {\tt uvnext} or {\tt uvscan}. The uv routines which need to
know if a uv variable has changed ({\tt uvprobvr}, {\tt uvcopyvr} and
{\tt uvupdated}) normally (i.e. by default) work on whether the particular
variable(s) of interest has changed since the last ``mark'' in the uv stream.
By default any routine which
causes more of the uv stream to be read ({\tt uvread}, {\tt uvscan} and
{\tt uvnext}) move this marker to the current point in the uv stream, before
reading more. The {\tt uvmark} routine provides greater control at
marking the position in the stream. Calling
\begin{verbatim}
      call uvmark(tno,.true.)
\end{verbatim}
sets the marker at the current position in the uv file, and disables
{\tt uvread}, etc, from resetting the marker. Calling
\begin{verbatim}
      call uvmark(tno,.false.)
\end{verbatim}
also sets the marker at the current position, and enables {\tt uvread}, etc,
to reset the marker on each call.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Arguments to UVSET, for STATUS=OLD}
\label{t:uvset-old}\end{table}
As mentioned above, the {\tt uvread} routine can perform, at the programmers
request, extra processing steps on the visibility data. These steps
consist of averaging and
resampling frequency channels, uv coordinate conversion and some corrections for
planet observations. The
steps are requested by calls to {\tt uvset}. In the call to {\tt uvset},
the argument {\tt object} (a string) gives the general processing step that
is being requested. The {\tt type} argument (another string)
gives more specific details, and the arguments {\tt n} (integer)
and {\tt p1}, {\tt p2} and {\tt p3} (reals) give any numerical values
needed.

Note that the set-up given by {\tt uvset} only becomes correctly
activated during the next call to {\tt uvread}. Before this next call,
the setup is in a somewhat nebulous state. So you should not expect
various other routines associated with {\tt uvread} to work
as expected until after the next call to {\tt uvread}. Associated
routines include {\tt uvflgwr} and {\tt uvinfo}.

Table~\ref{t:uvset-old} summarizes the possible values of the arguments to {\tt uvset}.
Here the column titled ``Object'' and ``Type'' are the possible string
values that {\tt object} and {\tt type} can take on. The third column
gives the meaning for the parameters \verb+n,p1,p2,p3+.
Dashes in the third column indicate that the arguments value is ignored in
this particular call. While several processing can be performed
simultaneously (several calls to {\tt uvset} will be needed to specify them
all), others are mutually inconsistent. When mutually inconsistent
steps are requested, the last requested step is honored. Each processing
step requires further explanation. 
\begin{description}
\item[\verb+object='data'+] This gives operations on the spectral
data. Type {\tt 'channel'} selects the channels to be returned, and possible
averaging together of the channel data. If the original channels are
numbers from 1 to $N$, then, by using \verb+type='channel'+, {\tt uvread} will
return $nchan$ massaged channels, where channel $i$ of the massaged channels
is formed by averaging $width$ channels of the original data, starting at
channel $(i-1)\cdot step + start$. If {\tt uvset} is
called with $nchan$ being zero, all channels are selected (note that this
only makes sense if $start$, $step$ and $width$ are all 1).

\verb+type='wide'+ is similar, but
uses the continuum data rather than the spectral data.

\verb+type='velocity'+ is also
similar, returning a weighted sum of the spectral data. However in this
case $start$, $width$ and $step$ are given in units of
km/s (rather than channels). This is particularly useful if the
spectrometer setup is not constant throughout the data or there is no
Doppler tracking, and so the velocity of a given channel changes.
Note that {\tt 'channel'}, {\tt 'wide'} and {\tt 'velocity'} are
mutually exclusive. The default is {\tt 'channel'} (or {\tt wide} if there is
no spectral data in the file), with start,increment
and width of 1.

If there are fewer than $nchan$ channels, then dummy channels, which are
flagged as bad, are added. If $nchan$ is specified as 0, then {\tt uvread}
will return as many channels as possible.

\item[\verb+object='reference'+] The ``reference line'' is a spectral channel,
or an average of spectral channels, which the main data is divided by. Typically
the reference line would be a strong point source (e.g. a maser). The resultant
data is essentially normalized and shifted, but it also has atmospheric-based
and instrument-base calibration problems removed. The extra parameters needed
to describe the reference line is the same as for \verb+object='data'+, except
that the number of channels, and the increment is ignored (there is only ever
one reference line). The default is not to have a reference line.
\item[\verb+object='coord'+] This sets the
units of the $u$ and $v$ coordinates returned in the preamble. Using
{\tt 'wavelength'} or {\tt 'nanosec'} sets the units of the returned $u$
and $v$. For {\tt 'wavelength'}, the sky frequency used is that of the first
channel returned. The default value is {\tt 'nanosec'}.
\item[\verb+object='planet'+] This causes 
the $u$ and $v$ coordinates to be scaled and rotated, and the correlation
values to be scaled,
to adjust for changes when observing planets.
The parameters {\tt plmaj, plmin} and {\tt plangle} give the reference
size (arcseconds) and position angle (degrees) of the planet. If the reference
size is 0, then the size of the first selected data record is used.
\item[\verb+object='selection'+] This gives extra control over the uv
selection process (see \ref{sect:select}). Currently there is only
one possible type, {\tt 'amplitude'}, which enables or disables the
amplitude selection process. If the argument {\tt n} is positive, then
amplitude selection is applied (i.e. the normal action), otherwise
amplitude selection is not applied.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Arguments to UVSET, for STATUS=NEW}
\label{t:uvset-new}
\end{table}
\begin{description}
\item[\verb+object='corr'+]
The uv routines allow the correlation data to be stored on disk, either
as floating point numbers, or as 16 bit integers with an associated scale
factor. The 16 bit format roughly halves the disk space required, but slows
the read and write operation, and can cause precision problems. On the
first call to {\tt uvwrite}, the uv routines decide on the format to
use, using a simple rule. The {\tt uvset} call
can be used to override this rule. To be of use, it must be called before
the first call to {\tt uvwrite}. The {\tt type} argument is a single
character, being {\tt `r'} or {\tt `j'}, which instructs floating
point or scaled integers, respectively, to be used.
\item[\verb+object='data'+] This conrtols whether {\tt UVWRITE} writes the
data to the {\tt corr} or {\tt wcorr} variable. The default is to write it
to the {\tt corr} item (i.e. it assumes that the data is spectral, rather
than continuum data).

\caption{Arguments to UVSELECT}
\label{t:uvselect}
\end{table}
Another function performed by {\tt uvread} is skip or flag data that is not
required. The routine {\tt uvselect} is used to instruct {\tt uvread} on
which data are to be selected and rejected. Normally the programmer will
not call {\tt uvselect} directly, but will use the {\tt SelInput} and
{\tt SelApply} routines (see Section~\ref{sect:select}). The Users Manual gives a description
about the way the user normally interacts with these routines.

Generally {\tt uvselect} will be
called many times, each call giving a different selection or discard criteria.
The routines {\tt SelInput} and {\tt SelApply} merely sequentially parse and pass
the user-given
criteria to {\tt uvselect}. Hence the `grammar' of the sequence of calls to
{\tt uvselect} (i.e. use of ``or'', or multiple occurrences of
criteria based on the same parameter) is the same as the `grammar' of the
user-specified task parameter. The `grammar' will not be repeated here.

The argument {\tt object} is a string giving the parameter on which a
select/discard criteria is based. The
arguments {\tt p1} and {\tt p2} (both double precision) give
added numerical parameters. Generally {\tt p1,p2} give a range of
parameter values to select or discard. Note that the units of the values are
consistent with the units of the underlying uv variables. These are not
necessarily the most convenient units for the user, and so the user
interface (given by SelInput and SelApply) performs some conversion
between user-units and program-units.

There are a few additions objects, when compared with the {\tt SelInput}
and {\tt SelApply}
routines. These include the {\tt ra} and {\tt dec} objects, which give the
pointing centre RA and DEC (after {\tt dra} and {\tt ddec} have been taken
into account). Another is the {\tt and} operator. {\tt Uvselect} treates
{\tt and} and {\tt or} as having identical precedence, and handles these
operators in the order in which they are given. Beware of this lack of
precedence.

The {\tt clear} object causes the selection criteria to be reset to its
default of selected everything.

The argument {\tt flag} determines
whether data which matches the associated criteria is to be selected
({\tt flag=.true.}) or discarded ({\tt flag=.false.}).

For example, to select data with Julian days 2444239.5 to 2444240.5 (i.e.
data for 1 January, 1980), use:
\begin{verbatim}
     call uvselect(tno,'time',2444239.5d0,2444240.5d0,.true.)
\end{verbatim}
To select all data, except for 1 January, 1980, use:
\begin{verbatim}
     call uvselect(tno,'time',2444239.5d0,2444240.5d0,.false.)
\end{verbatim}
Note: In the {\tt 'antennae'} criteria, an antennae number of 0 is treated
as a ``match-all'' number.

\subsection{Getting Information After UVREAD}

\end{tabular}
\caption{Arguments to UVINFO}
\label{t:uvinfo}
\end{table}
The routine {\tt uvinfo} returns information about the data returned by
the last call to {\tt uvread}. The argument {\tt object} is a character
string indicating the information that is desired. The argument {\tt data}
is a double precision array, containing the returned information.
Possible values for {\tt object} are:
\begin{description}
\item[\verb+'restfreq'+] {\tt Data} contains the rest frequency (GHz) for
each channel returned by {\tt uvread}.
\item[\verb+'velocity'+] {\tt Data} contains the velocity (km/s) for each
channel returned by {\tt uvread}.
\item[\verb+'frequency'+] {\tt Data} contains the frequency (GHz) of the
channel returned by {\tt uvread}, after removing the doppler contribution.
\item[\verb+'bandwidth'+] {\tt Data} contains the bandwidth (GHz) of each
channel returned by {\tt uvread}.
\item[\verb+'sfreq'+] {\tt Data} contains the sky frequency (GHz) of each
channel returned by {\tt uvread}.
\item[\verb+'visno'+] {\tt Data} contains a single number, which is the
visibility number (running from 1 upwards) of the last channel read.
\item[\verb+'amprange'+] {\tt Data} contains three values. The first value
indicate the sort of amplitude selection that was requested for this
record, and the second and third values give a flux range.
Possible value of data(1) are -1 (data outside the range [data(2),data(3)]
were rejected), 0 (no amplitude selection was active) or +1 (data inside the
range [data(2),data(3)] were rejected).
\end{description}
For example, consider the following code fragment.
\begin{verbatim}
      integer maxchan
      parameter(maxchan=512)
      integer tno,nread
      complex data(maxchan)
      logical flags(maxchan)
      double precision preamble(4),velocity(maxchan)
           .
           .
           .
      call uvread(tno,preamble,data,flags,maxchan,nread)
      call uvinfo(tno,'velocity',velocity)
\end{verbatim}
After the call to {\tt uvinfo} will contain the velocity of each channel
read by {\tt uvread}.

\section{UV Selection -- SelInput and SelApply}\index{uv-selection}
\label{sect:select}
\begin{verbatim}
     subroutine SelInput(key,sels,maxsels)
     logical function SelProbe(sels,object,value)
     subroutine SelApply(tno,sels,flag)
\end{verbatim}
These routines are the usual programmer interface to the uv selection
routines. They perform the parsing and checking of the user input, and
the calling of the {\tt uvselect} routine to actually implement the
selection process. For
more information see uv selection in the Users Manual, and the {\tt uvselect}
routine in this Programmers Manual.

{\tt SelInput} calls the {\tt keya} routine to get the user-specified
selection criteria. This criteria is then broken into an intermediate form.
The argument {\tt key} is the keyword to be used. Generally it should be
{\tt 'select'}. The real array {\tt sels} (of size {\tt maxsels} elements)
is used to hold the intermediate form of the selection.

{\tt SelApply} takes a selection criteria, in its intermediate form, and
calls the {\tt uvselect} routine to apply it. The argument {\tt flag} determines
whether criteria is actually to be used for selection ({\tt flag=.true.}), or
rejection ({\tt flag=.false.}).


\begin{table}\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}					   \hline
\bf Object	& \bf Units				\\ \hline
time		& Julian day.				\\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Arguments to SelProbe}
\label{t:selprobe}
\end{table}

{\tt SelProbe} returns information about whether uv data with a particular
parameter value may have been selected.
It does not guarantee that such data might exist
in any particular data file. It also has the limitation that
information is not present to convert ``uvrange'' and ``uvnrange''
calls into each other. These should be treated with caution. The {\tt sels}
array is the intermediate form returned by {\tt SelInput}, and {\tt value}
is a double precision value, giving the parameter value that is of interest.
The {\tt object} argument determines the meaning (and the units) of this
value. Possible values are given in Table~\ref{t:selprobe}.

Note that this does not support all objects to {\tt uvselect}.
The name must be given in full (no abbreviations and case is significant).

\section{The UVDAT routines}\index{uv-data}\index{uvdat}
The {\tt uvdat} routines are a layer of routines which sit on top of the {\tt uvio}
routines. They are used to read old uv data-sets. They perform a number of
functions commonly used in handling uv data. The services include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Retrieve a number of standard task parameters (dealing with uv files) from the
user. These include the {\tt vis}, {\tt line}, {\tt select}, {\tt stokes} and
{\tt ref} keywords. The uvDat routines support processing of several visibility
files, and simplifies the book-keeping involved in tracking the several files.
\item Apply antenna gain solutions to the data on the fly, if applicable.
\item Perform polarization conversion steps, if required.
\end{itemize}

The {\tt uvdat} routines still allow the programmer to use most of the {\tt uvio}
routines, to get the best of both worlds.
Routines available are:
\begin{verbatim}
      subroutine uvDatInp(key,flags)
      logical function uvDatOpn(tno)
      subroutine uvDatCls()
      subroutine uvDatRd(preamble,data,flags,n,nread)
      subroutine uvDatWRd(data,flags,n,nread)
      subroutine uvDatGti(object,ival)
      subroutine uvDatGtr(object,rval)
      subroutine uvDatGta(object,aval)
      subroutine uvDatSet(object,ival)
      logical function uvDatPrb(object,dval)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{table}\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline

\verb+'b'+	& Input must be a single file.\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Flag Values for the uvDatInp Call}
\label{t:uvdatinp}
\end{table}

The {\tt uvDatInp} routine is called to setup the uvDat routines, and to
retrieve the user parameters. The {\tt key} argument (a character string)
gives the name of the keyword to use to retrieve the input visibility
data-set name. Normally it will be {\tt 'vis'}. The {\tt flags} argument
specifies what processing steps are to be
performed, and which user parameters to retrieve. The {\tt flags} argument is a
character string, each character representing a processing step or parameter
retrieval request. The legitimate characters are given in
Table~\ref{t:uvdatinp}.

The {\tt uvDatInp} subroutine should be called when retrieving task parameters
(i.e. between calls to {\tt keyini} and {\tt keyfin}. It does not open any files.

The logical function {\tt uvDatOpn} is responsible for opening the requested
uv data-set, and performing most of the initialization steps (e.g. calling
uvio routines to set the selection, linetype and planet processing options
requested by its caller and by the user). {\tt uvDatOpn} returns {\tt .true.}
if a visibility file was successfully opened. Otherwise it returns {\tt .false.},
indicating that there are no more files to process. {\tt uvDatOpn} also returns
the handle of the opened uv data-set, in the variable {\tt tno}. The routine
{\tt uvDatCls} closes the opened uv data-set. When dealing with several files,
the caller will go through the sequence: {\tt uvDatOpn}, read data, {\tt uvDatCls},
until {\tt uvDatOpn} returns {\tt .false.} (indicating no more files).

After opening, the {\tt uvDatRd} routine can be used to read through the data.
The arguments are the same as the {\tt uvread} call, except that the file handle
({\tt tno}) is not required. The routine {\tt uvDatWRd} is equivalent to the
{\tt uvwread} routine -- that is it reads the ``wide'' channels, ignoring the
current linetype.

The {\tt uvDatGt} routines are a set of inquiry routines, for the caller to
determine what is going on inside the {\tt uvdat} routines. Blurb-blurb.

The {\tt uvDatSet} routine is used for the caller to instruct {\tt uvdat} on what to
do. Blurb-blurb

The {\tt uvDatPrb} routine is used in exactly the same way (with the same
restrictions) as the {\tt SelProbe} routine -- it is used to
determine information about the selection criteria in force. Its arguments are the
same as the {\tt SelProbe} routine, except that the {\tt sels} array is not needed
(this array is stored internally in the {\tt uvdat} routines.

\section{Image Data Sets}\index{image-data}
These routines access image data sets.
\begin{verbatim}
      subroutine xyopen(tno,dataname,status,naxis,nsize)
      subroutine xyclose(tno)
      subroutine xyread(tno,index,array)
      subroutine xywrite(tno,index,array)
      subroutine xysetpl(tno,naxis,nsize)
\end{verbatim}
Here {\tt xyopen} opens the image data set, and readies it for reading or
writing. {\tt Dataname} is the name of the data set, {\tt status} is either
{\tt `old'} or {\tt `new'}, depending on whether an old data set is being opened
to be read, or a new data set is being created. {\tt Naxis} gives the dimension
of the {\tt nsize} array. {\tt Naxis} is always an input parameter.
{\tt Nsize} gives the size, along each axis of the
image. When opening an old data set, {\tt nsize} is filled in by {\tt xyopen},
and passed back to the caller. For a new data set, {\tt nsize} must be set to the
size of the desired image before the open routine is called. The argument
{\tt tno} is the handle passed back by the open routine, and is used
in all subsequent calls to identify the data set.

{\tt Xyclose} closes the data set.

{\tt Xyread} and {\tt xywrite} read or write a single row of the image. 
The row number is given by {\tt index}, and the pixel data is stored in
{\tt array} (a real array). By default, {\tt xyread} and {\tt xywrite} access
a row in the first image of a multi-image data set. The routine {\tt xysetpl}
is used to change this default to another image. In this {\tt naxis} gives the
dimension of the {\tt nsize} array, and {\tt nsize} is an integer array
giving the indices along the third, fourth, etc, dimension of access. For
example, to access the n'th image in a cube, use:
\begin{verbatim}

      call xysetpl(tno,1,n)

\end{verbatim}

\section{Image Coordinate System}
\miriad\ defines and stores image coordinate system information in a similar
fashion to AIPS and FITS. Most cubes will have coordinates along its three
axis of RA, DEC and velocity. The item {\tt ctype} gives the
type of coordinate along a particular axis, whereas {\tt crval, crpix} and
{\tt cdelt} give the value of the coordinate at the reference pixel, the
value of the reference pixel, and the increment between pixels, respectively.
Unlike AIPS and FITS, RA and DEC are given in radians, and velocity is given
in km/sec. RA and DEC will generally need to be converted to
hours,minutes,seconds, or degrees,minutes,seconds, before being presented
to the user.

\begin{table}\centering
\begin{tabular}{|lcccl|}\hline
Ctype & Crval & Crpix & Cdelt & Equation		\\ \hline
{\tt RA---xxx}& $\alpha_0$ & $i_0$ & $\Delta\alpha$ &
  $\alpha=\alpha_0+\Delta\alpha/\cos(\delta_0)(i-i_0)$	\\
{\tt DEC--xxx}& $\delta_0$ & $i_0$ & $\Delta\delta$ &
  $\delta=\delta_0+\Delta\delta(i-i_0)$			\\
{\tt VELO-xxx}& $v_0$ & $i_0$ & $\Delta v$ &
  $v=v_0+\Delta v(i-i_0)$				\\
Others& $x_0$ & $i_0$ & $\Delta x$ &
  $x=x_0+\Delta x(i-i_0)$				\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Image Coordinate System}
\label{t:coord}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{t:coord} gives quite approximate formulae for converting from
pixel number to an astronomical coordinate. For more accurate formulae, see
AIPS Memo No. 27, ``Non-linear Coordinate Systems in AIPS'' (Eric Greisen).

For example, the following code fragment calculates RA, DEC and velocity.
\begin{table}
\begin{verbatim}
      character ctype1*8,ctype2*8,ctype3*8
      double precision crval1,crpix1,cdelt1,crval2,crpix2,cdelt2
      double precision crval3,crpix3,cdelt3
      double precision alpha,delta,v
      integer i,j,k
          .
          .
      (assume i,j,k contains the grid coordinate of interest)
          .
      call rdhda(tno,'ctype1',ctype1,' ')
      if(ctype1(1:5).ne.'RA---')
     *    call bug('f','First axis is not RA')
      call rdhda(tno,'ctype2',ctype2,' ')
      if(ctype2(1:5).ne.'DEC--')
     *    call bug('f','Second axis is not DEC')
      call rdhda(tno,'ctype3',ctype3,' ')
      if(ctype1(1:5).ne.'VELO-')
     *    call bug('f','Third axis is not velocity')
      call rdhdd('crval1',crval1,0.d0)
      call rdhdd('crval2',crval2,0.d0)
      call rdhdd('crval3',crval3,0.d0)
      call rdhdd('crpix1',crpix1,1.d0)
      call rdhdd('crpix2',crpix2,1.d0)
      call rdhdd('crpix3',crpix3,1.d0)
      call rdhdd('cdelt1',cdelt1,1.d0)
      call rdhdd('cdelt2',cdelt3,1.d0)
      call rdhdd('cdelt3',cdelt3,1.d0)
      alpha = crval1 + cdelt1/cos(crval2)*(i-crpix1)
      delta = crval2 + cdelt2            *(j-crpix2)
      v     = crval3 + cdelt3            *(k-crpix3)
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Coordinate System Code Example}
\end{table}

This code fragment checks that the  axis are in the order RA, DEC then velocity
(i.e. the normal ordering)
and aborts if they are not. Smarter code would allow them in any order, and
would probably treat any unrecognized ctype as a linear coordinate system.
It uses default values (if values of crval, crpix and cdelt are missing)
of 0, 1 and 1. Probably better default values could be chosen, though if
ctype is an item, then we can be fairly certain that the other parameters
will also be present.

\section{Region of Interest and Pixel Blanking}\index{region-of-interest}
\index{blanking}
It is a common situation for the user to want to process a limited subset
of an image. It is also common for an image to contain pixels which are
``blanked'' or have an ``undefined value''. \miriad\ routines are available to
treat these two pixel selection operations together. The input to these
routines are the task parameters which describe the subregion the user
is interested in, and a masking item that may be associated with an image.
The output is a description of the pixels selected.

Each image dataset may have a masking item. This
is a bitmap containing a flag for each pixel, indicating
whether the pixel is good or bad. For bad pixels, the pixel value actually
stored
in the image is not defined, though it will be a legal or typical value.
Zero, or the value of the pixel before blanking, is a good choice.

\subsection{Regular Regions of Interest}
Generally a minimum of three routines are needed to process even ``regular''
regions of interest. By ``regular'' we mean that the region of interest is
describable by a bottom left corner and top right corner (i.e. it is a filled
grid). The routines of interest are:
\begin{verbatim}
        subroutine BoxInput(key,dataset,boxes,maxboxes)
        subroutine BoxSet(boxes,naxis,nsize,flags)
        subroutine BoxInfo(boxes,naxis,blc,trc)
\end{verbatim}
All routines require an integer array, {\tt boxes}, which is used to
accumulate a description of the region of interest. Its size is given
by argument {\tt maxboxes}. The required size is a function of the
complexity of the region of interest, etc. Typically 1024 elements
should be adequate.

{\tt BoxInput} reads the task parameters that the user gives to
specify the region of interest. The way this is specified is moderately
general and (consequently) complex. See the description in the users guide.
Included is the ability to give the region specification in a variety of
units. To convert between some units and absolute pixels, {\tt BoxInput}
needs information about the coordinate system being used (e.g.
parameters {\tt crval}, {\tt crpix} and {\tt cdelt}). {\tt BoxInput} determines
these from the \miriad\ data-set given by {\tt dataset}. Normally this is the name
of the image dataset which we are interested in. If {\tt dataset} is
blank, {\tt BoxInput} still functions correctly, but cannot perform unit
conversion.

{\tt BoxInput} breaks up the specification into an intermediate form, and
stores it in the {\tt boxes} array.
The keyword associated with the task parameter is {\tt key},
which would normally be {\tt 'region'}. If the {\tt key} argument is blank,
{\tt BoxInput} does not attempt to get a region-of-interest specification,
but instead just initialises the {\tt boxes} array with the default
region-of-interest.

The programmer passes to {\tt BoxSet} information about the size of the image
of interest. This is given in the integer array {\tt nsize}, which consists
if {\tt naxis} elements (as with the corresponding arguments to {\tt xyopen}).
The {\tt flags} argument is an input character string, giving information
about the default region of interest. It can consist of:
\begin{itemize}
\item[q] The default region of interest is the inner quarter of the image.
\item[1] The default region of interest consists of the first plane only.
\item[s] The region of interest must be ``regular''. If it is not, {\tt BoxSet}
generates a warning message, and will use the bounding box of the selected
region.
\end{itemize}

{\tt BoxInfo} returns integer arrays {\tt blc} and {\tt trc}, which give the
bottom
left corner and top right corner of the region which encloses the overall
region of interest. Both these arrays are of size {\tt naxis} integers.

\subsection{Arbitrary Regions of Interest and Blanking Information}
In addition to the above routines, there are three routines to allow treatment
of more complex regions of interest. These are:
\begin{verbatim}
        subroutine BoxMask(tno,boxes,maxboxes)
        logical function BoxRect(boxes)
        subroutine BoxRuns(naxis,nsize,flags,boxes,
    *        runs,maxruns,nruns,xblx,xtrc,yblc,ytrc)
\end{verbatim}

{\tt BoxMask} requests that an image mask be ANDed with the region
requested by the user. The input to the routine is the image dataset handle,
{\tt tno}, whereas the {\tt boxes} array is an input/output integer array
used to accumulate region of interest information. {\tt BoxMask} can be
called multiple times, each time ANDing in a new image mask. This is an optional
routine. Typically it would be called for each of the input images, so that
``blanked'' pixels in the input images would be excluded from the region of
interest.

{\tt BoxRect} returns {\tt .true.} if the region
of interest is rectangular (i.e. whether the region of interest is entirely
described by {\tt blc} and {\tt trc}.

{\tt BoxRuns} returns the region selected for a particular plane.
The input arguments {\tt naxis} and {\tt nsize} are analogous to the same
arguments in the {\tt xysetpl} routine. {\tt runs} is
an integer array of size $3\times maxruns$. On output it indicates which
pixels in the plane are to be process.
{\tt Runs} consists of {\tt nruns} entries of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
     j,imin,imax
\end{verbatim}
This indicates that pixels (imin,j) to (imax,j) are to be processed.
All entries are non-overlapping.
There may be zero or many  entries for a particular value of j. The
table is in increasing order of j and imin. On output, the integers
{\tt xblc, xtrc, yblc} and {\tt ytrc} give the bottom left and top right
corners, in x and y, of the smallest subimage which contains the selected
pixels.
The {\tt flags} argument, an input character
string, indicates some extra options. These are:
\begin{itemize}
\item[r] Make the coordinates, returned in the {\tt runs} table,
relative to {\tt (xblc,yblc)}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reading and Writing Blanking Information}
Though the {\tt box} routines are the preferred way to read blanking
information, it is possible to read the blanking information associated with
an image directly. Also a routine is needed to write blanking information.
Blanking information can be read and written by two sets of routines.
These routines are:
\begin{verbatim}

      subroutine xyflgrd(tno,index,mask)
      subroutine xyflgwr(tno,index,mask)
      subroutine xymkrd(tno,index,runs,n,nread)
      subroutine xymkwr(tno,index,runs,n)

\end{verbatim}
Here {\tt tno} is the image handle returned by {\tt xyopen}, {\tt index} gives
the row number (analogous to {\tt xyread} and {\tt xywrite}).
Analogous to the working of {\tt xyread} and {\tt xywrite}, the plane of the
masking file that the routines access is set with the {\tt xysetpl} routine.

The {\tt xyflgrd} and {\tt xyflgwr} routines read and write the logical
array {\tt mask}. The {\tt mask} array has a {\tt .true.} value if the
corresponding pixel is good, or {\tt .false.} if it is bad (or blanked).

The {\tt xymkrd} and {\tt xymkwr} routines read and write a ``{\tt runs}''
array. The {\tt runs} array is a table of the form:
\begin{verbatim}

    imin,imax

\end{verbatim}
where pixels {\tt imin} to {\tt imax} are good (not blanked). Note that
the size of {\tt runs} is {\tt n} integers of {\tt n/2} pairs of
ordinates. {\tt Runs} is input to
{\tt xywrite} and output from {\tt xyread}. For {\tt xyread}, {\tt nread}
returns the number of elements of {\tt runs} that have been filled in.

Because many images are completely good (i.e. no blanked pixels),
it would be superfluous to always carry around blanking information.
Hence the
mask containing the blanking information need not exist. If it does not
exist, the read routines described above will return indicating that all
pixels are good.
A programmer can check if the mask exists, using the logical function
{\tt hdprsnt}:
\begin{verbatim}

     logical exists
     logical hdprsnt
          .
          .
          .
     exists = hdprsnt(tno,'mask')

\end{verbatim}

\section{Scratch Files}\index{scratch-files}
\begin{verbatim}

      subroutine scropen(tno)
      subroutine scrread(tno,buffer,offset,length)
      subroutine scrwrite(tno,buffer,offset,length)
      subroutine scrclose(tno)

\end{verbatim}
The scratch i/o routines are used to create and read and write from a
scratch file containing real-valued data. Here {\tt tno} is a handle passed
back by the open routine,
and must be used in all subsequent calls to the scratch i/o routines.
{\tt Scrread} and {\tt scrwrite} read and write scratch data to/from the
real array {\tt buffer}. {\tt Length} values are accessed, starting
at the offset given by {\tt offset} (for a scratch file of $N$ real
values, {\tt offset} can vary from 0 to $N-1$).

\section{General Item Routines}\index{item-routines}
These routines read and write ``small'' items (items consisting of a single
value), or perform some operation on an entire item.

In many processing systems these routines would be called ``header handling''
routines. This has led to the rather misleading use of the
letters ``hd'' as a component of each of the following routine names.
\begin{verbatim}

      subroutine rdhda(tno,itemname,value,default)
      subroutine rdhri(tno,itemname,value,default)
      subroutine rdhdr(tno,itemname,value,default)
      subroutine rdhdd(tno,itemname,value,default)
      subroutine rdhdc(tno,itemname,value,default)
      subroutine wrhda(tno,itemname,value)
      subroutine wrhdi(tno,itemname,value)
      subroutine wrhdr(tno,itemname,value)
      subroutine wrhdd(tno,itemname,value)
      subroutine wrhdc(tno,itemname,value)
      logical function hdprsnt(tno,itemname)
      subroutine hdcopy(tin,tout,itemname)
      subroutine hdprobe(tno,itemname,descr,type,n)

\end{verbatim}
Before these can be accessed, the data set must be
opened with either {\tt xyopen}, {\tt uvopen} or {\tt hopen}. {\tt Tno} is the
handle returned by these open routines.
The name of the item to access is given by {\tt itemname} (a string).
These names should be up to 8 lowercase alphanumeric
characters, and (where possible) they should conform to the FITS standard.
The {\tt rdhd} routines read an item, returning its value in {\tt value}.
The routines {\tt rdhda, rdhdi, rdhdr, rdhdd} and {\tt rdhdc} return a string,
integer, real, double precision or complex value, respectively. If the item
is not found, the {\tt rdhd} routines return the default value given
by {\tt default} (note {\tt value} and {\tt default} should be a string,
integer, real, double precision or complex values, depending on the routine
called). Similarly
the {\tt wrhd} routines save the value of an item.

The logical function {\tt hdprsnt} can be called to determine if a
particular item exists.

The routine {\tt hdcopy} copies an item from one data set to another.
The item can be
arbitrarily large. {\tt Hdcopy} copies from the data set, whose handle
is given by {\tt tin}, to the data set whose handle is {\tt tout}.

The routine {\tt hdprobe} is used to probe the characteristics of an
item.  The string {\tt descr} returns a brief description of the item
(intended for people, not programs, to read). If the item consists of a 
single value (or string), the description gives the value. Otherwise
the description gives the type and size of the item (in human readable
form). The string {\tt type} is one of {\tt 'nonexistent',
'integer*2', 'integer', 'real', 'double', 'complex', 'character', 'text'}
or {\tt 'binary'} (unknown type). The integer {\tt n} gives the number
of elements in the item. If the item does not exist, {\tt type} returns
{\tt 'nonexistent'} and {\tt n} returns zero.

\section{History Item}\index{history-file}
Most data sets will have an associated history item. This is a text file
containing a description of the data set, and the processing that has been
performed on it. The routines to access the history item are as follows:
\begin{verbatim}

      subroutine hisopen(tno,status)
      subroutine hisread(tno,line,eof)
      subroutine hiswrite(tno,line)
      subroutine hisinput(tno,taskname)
      subroutine hisclose(tno)

\end{verbatim}
{\tt Hisopen} must be called before the history item can be accessed. Here
{\tt tno} is the handle passed back by a previous call to {\tt xyopen}
or {\tt uvopen}, and {\tt status} is a string which can be either
{\tt 'read'}, {\tt 'write'} or {\tt 'append'}. {\tt Hisread} and {\tt hiswrite} can be
called to read from, or append to the history item a line at a time
({\tt line} is a character string). When reading, the
logical value {\tt eof} turns true when the end of the history item is
encountered. {\tt Hisinput} writes a number of history comments, giving
the command line input parameters. This is a particularly useful routine
to summarize user inputs. For {\tt hisinput}, {\tt taskname} is the name
of the task. {\tt Hisclose} closes the history item.

Note that there is no routine to copy a history file from one dataset to
another. This is easily performed using the {\tt hdcopy} routine described
in the previous section.

For uniformities sake, history comments follow a standard format. The
following is an example of the history comments written by the task
DEMOS:
\begin{verbatim}
DEMOS: Miriad DeMos: version 1.0 30-apr-90'
DEMOS: Input parameters are
DEMOS:   vis=uvn
DEMOS:   map=mosclean
DEMOS: Pointing offset used (arcsec):   24.0 -30.0
\end{verbatim}
Note that all comments start with the task name. The first comment gives a
version date of the program. The next
three lines were generated by {\tt HisInput}, and the last line was an
extra comment.

\section{Low Level I/O Routines}\index{low-level-i/o}
All i/o routines described above are built on top of a set of
low level routines. In \miriad, a ``data set'' is a collection of 
named items. Each item is an unstructured, byte addressable collection of data.
It is up
to the higher level software to impose some structure to the data items, and
to provide a better interface for the high level programmer.
The higher level routines should be adequate for most
programmers. Though direct use of the following low level routines is
discouraged, there are some instances where they may be needed.
\begin{verbatim}

      subroutine hopen(tno,dataname,status,iostat)
      subroutine hclose(tno,iostat)
      subroutine haccess(tno,item,itemname,status,iostat)
      subroutine hdaccess(item,iostat)
      subroutine hdelete(tno,itemname,iostat)
      integer function hsize(item)

      subroutine hreada(item,buffer,iostat)
      subroutine hreadb(item,buffer,offset,length,iostat)
      subroutine hreadj(item,buffer,offset,length,iostat)
      subroutine hreadi(item,buffer,offset,length,iostat)
      subroutine hreadr(item,buffer,offset,length,iostat)
      subroutine hreadd(item,buffer,offset,length,iostat)

      subroutine hwritea(item,buffer,iostat)
      subroutine hwriteb(item,buffer,offset,length,iostat)
      subroutine hwritej(item,buffer,offset,length,iostat)
      subroutine hwritei(item,buffer,offset,length,iostat)
      subroutine hwriter(item,buffer,offset,length,iostat)
      subroutine hwrited(item,buffer,offset,length,iostat)

\end{verbatim}
Only two operations can be performed on a data set as a whole, namely to
open and to close it. The routines to perform these are
{\tt hopen} and {\tt hclose}. Here {\tt tno} is a handle passed back
by {\tt hopen}, {\tt dataname} is a string giving the name of the data set,
and {\tt status} is either {\tt 'old'} (when accessing an old data set)
or {\tt 'new'} (when creating a data set). {\tt Iostat} is a error
indicator, being zero if the operation was successful. Because of
buffering performed by the i/o routines, it is very 
important to close a data set when it is no longer needed.

Before any item can be read or written, it must be ``opened'' with the
{\tt haccess} routine. The inputs to this are: {\tt tno} (the handle passed
back by {\tt hopen}); {\tt itemname}, a string giving the item name;
{\tt status}, a string which can be {\tt 'read'}, {\tt 'write'} {\tt 'append'}
or {\tt 'scratch'} (if an item is opened with {\tt status='scratch'}, an item
is created, but then destroyed when the item is closed). The outputs from
{\tt haccess} are firstly a handle, {\tt item}, which is used to perform i/o on
the item, and secondly a status return, {\tt iostat}. All items should be
closed down, with {\tt hdaccess}, before the data set as a whole is closed. 

The {\tt hdelete} subroutine deletes an item.
The integer function {\tt hsize} returns the size of an item in bytes.

There are a group of i/o routines provided to read and write items. Because
items are stored in a machine independent format, there are separate i/o
routines for each data type.  Each i/o routine performs the conversion between
the external (disk) format and the hosts internal format. For example, the
{\tt hreadr} routine reads real numbers. On disk, \miriad\ reals are stored
as IEEE floating point numbers. Internally, however, reals are stored in the
hosts machines ``real number format''. The {\tt hreadr} routine performs the
conversion. The read/write
routines know nothing about the type of the data it is accessing. The
caller must know this, and call the appropriate read/write routine.

All read/write routines take the handle {\tt item} (passed back by
{\tt haccess}) as their first argument, and pass back an i/o status as the last
argument. The second argument is a buffer, which can be either a character
string ({\tt hreada, hwritea, hreadb, hwriteb}), an integer array ({\tt hreadj,
hwritej, hreadi, hwritei}), real ({\tt hreadr, hwriter}) or double precision
({\tt hreadd, hwrited)}. {\tt Hreada} and {\tt hwritea} read/write a text file,
performing i/o on a line at a time. Text files are stored using a line-feed
character to delimit the end of a line (i.e. the normal UNIX convention, or the
VMS Stream\_LF convention). The routines {\tt hreadb} and {\tt hwriteb} perform
i/o on bytes, no conversion being performed -- these routines should rarely be
needed). The routines {\tt hreadj} and {\tt hwritej} assume the integers are
externally stored as 16 bit quantities, whereas {\tt hreadi} and {\tt hwritei}
assume the integers are externally stored as 32 bit quantities. Internally,
integers are always stored in the hosts standard integer format ({\tt int}
in C, and an {\tt INTEGER} in FORTRAN. Real and double
precision values are externally stored in IEEE 32 bit and 64 bit floating point
format. All read/write routines (except {\tt hreada} and {\tt hwritea}) take
(as inputs) a byte {\tt offset} and byte {\tt length} as their third and fourth
arguments. Both {\tt offset} and {\tt length} must be a multiple of the size
of the data type being accessed (e.g. they must be a multiple of 4 for
reals, or 8 for double precision numbers). Apart from this alignment
restriction, data items can be read in a random fashion.

All I/O routines pass back an i/o status indicator. A value of zero
indicates success, -1 indicates end-of-file, and any other values indicate
some other error (that is system dependent).

\section{Numeric Routines}
The following numeric routines should be used in preference to others that do
the same function, as these are reasonably optimized. Generally these are
tailored to the target machine (e.g. on the Cray these are
based on Cray SCILIB routines, on the Convex, they are partially based
on VECLIB routines).
\subsection{FFT Routines}
\index{fft}\index{fourier-transform}
There are three FFT routines, namely:
\begin{verbatim}

      subroutine fftrc(in,out,sign,n)
      subroutine fftcr(in,out,sign,n)
      subroutine fftcc(in,out,sign,n)

\end{verbatim}
These perform one-dimensional FFTs. In all cases, {\tt sign} is the sign
of the exponent in the transform (i.e. a {\tt sign} of -1 is conventionally
viewed as a forward transform), and {\tt n} is a power of 2 giving the
length of the (full) sequence. ${1\over N}$ scaling is never performed
(it is up to you to scale at the best time). {\tt In} is the input
array, and {\tt out} is the output array. These routines
evaluate:
\[
Out(l)=\sum_{k=1}^N In(k)\exp(\pm j {2\pi\over N} (k-1)(l-1))
\]
where $k$ and $l$ vary from $1$ to $N$.
{\tt Fftrc} transforms a real
sequence (i.e. {\tt in} is a real array) and outputs only the first $N/2 + 1$
complex values. No information is lost because of the conjugate
symmetry of FFTs of real sequences. Conversely {\tt fftcr} takes a
complex sequence of length $N/2+1$ and produces a real sequence of length $N$.
Finally {\tt fftcc} performs a complex to complex transform, with
both input and output being of length $N$.

\subsection{Min and Max Value Routines}\index{scilib}\index{vector}
There are two routines to find the index of the minimum and maximum values
of an array, namely:
\begin{verbatim}

      integer function IsMin(n,data,step)
      integer function IsMax(n,data,step)

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{WHEN and ISRCH Routines}
\begin{verbatim}

      subroutine whenxxx(n,array,step,target,index,nindex)
      integer function isrchxxx(n,array,step,target)

\end{verbatim}
The {\tt when} routines return the indices of all locations in an array that
have a ``true relational value'' to the target. See page 4-64 of the
Cray ``Library Reference Manual'' for more information. The {\tt isrch}
routines return the first location in an array that has a ``true
relational value'' to the target. See page 4-59 of the Cray ``Library
Reference Manual''. For both routines, ``{\tt xxx}'' can be one of
{\tt ieq, ine, ilt, ile, igt, ige, feq, fne, flt, fle, fgt} or {\tt fge}.
These give the type of {\tt array} (Integer or Floating), and the relation
(equal, not equal, less than, etc).

Because these are well optimized routines, these routines should be used in
preference to straightforward FORTRAN
code that performs an equivalent function.

\subsection{Blas and Linpack Routines}\index{blas}\index{linpack}
The Blas routines are ``Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms'', while the
Linpack routines are a suite of linear equation solving routines. It is
common to find these routines, in an optimized form, on vector computers.
Additionally they are public domain routines in standard FORTRAN, making them
easy to port. The \miriad\ library (or a system library) has
these routines in their single precision real and complex forms.
There are a number of good references on Blas and Linpack routines
available (e.g. 4-1 and 4-38 in the Cray ``Library Reference Manual'',
or the Convex ``VECLIB Users Manual'').

\chapter{Utility Programs}\label{ch:utilities}
A few programs have been developed to simplify the development of good
portable code.

\section{FLINT}\index{flint}
Flint is a FORTRAN program checker. It aims at uncovering programming
bugs and bad programming practises. Given FORTRAN source as input, Flint
produces warnings on the terminal and in a listing file (flint.log).
Flint checks for variables which are unused, uninitialized or
undeclared. It also checks that the number, type and intent of arguments
passed to a subroutine remains consistent amongst all calls (an arguments
intent is whether its  value is input to, or output from a routine).
\begin{verbatim}
     flint [-acdfhjkrsux2?] [-I incdir] [-o file] [-l] file ...
\end{verbatim}
There are many command line switches (though the defaults are usually adequate).
Invoking Flint with the ``?'' switch causes it to print out brief information
about Flint, and all the command line switches. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
     flint -?
\end{verbatim}
will give some help information.

\subsection{Making Flint Quieter}
Flint assumes that the programmer follows a fairly strict programming
convention. If the programmer does not, then Flint can produce a voluminous
number of warning messages. There are a number of switches which help
quieten Flint to manageable proportions.
\begin{description}
\item[--c] Allow interwoven continuation and comment lines. Normally Flint
generates warnings about this (even though it is standard FORTRAN)
An unpleasant side effect of allowing interwoven
comment and continuation lines is that comments are not copied to the
listing file.
\item[--d] Do not warn when variables are not explicitly declared. Normally
Flint insists that all variables must be explicitly declared with a `REAL',
`INTEGER', etc, statement.
\item[--f] Do not generate warnings about lines greater than 72 characters long
or with an odd number of quotes. When checking if a line is
greater than 72 characters, Flint interprets tabs as if the equivalent
number of spaces had been typed (the VMS compiler treats a tab as a single
character, rather than as multiple spaces).
\item[--h] By default, Flint does not understand hollerith data. The {\tt -h}
flag instructs Flint to recognize hollerith data as integers.
\item[--j] Do not check if a variable has been initialized before being used.
If a variable is not in a DATA, COMMON, PARAMETER or SAVE statement,
and if it is not a dummy subroutine argument, then Flint normally
attempts to check that the variable is initialized before it is used. It does
this by checking that it is assigned to at a earlier line in the routine than
where it is first used. This is not necessarily correct in routines with
EQUIVALENCE statements, a maze of gotos, or which
have conditional blocks within loops. Applying this same rule to subroutine
arguments provides Flint with a technique for determining subroutine argument
intent. Disabling initialization checking will also disable these
intent-determining rules, and so should eliminate
spurious warnings about inconsistent subroutine argument intent.
\item[--k] Suppress warnings about common blocks with possible alignment
problems.
\item[--r] Do not warn about seemingly redundant variables. Redundant variables
are those that are assigned to but never otherwise used. A common
source of most messages is when a value returned by a subroutine
is never used. For example, Flint will complain if you ignore values
returned in an array used by a subroutine for scratch storage, or if values
returned by a general subroutine are ignored in specific cases.
\item[--s] Load definitions of FORTRAN-IV and specific intrinsic functions.
By default, Flint only knows about the standard FORTRAN-77 generic intrinsic
functions (e.g. COS, REAL, MAX). It does not know specific function names
or obsolete FORTRAN-IV functions (e.g. DCOS, FLOAT, AMAX0). The `s'
flag causes Flint to load the definitions of these as well.
\item[--u] Do not generate a warning about variables which do not seem to be
used. By default Flint produces such a warning for local variables (but
not COMMON or PARAMETER variables).
\item[--x] Allow extended subroutine and variable names. By default Flint
warns if subroutine or variable names are longer than 8 characters, or if
they contain underline or dollar characters. Using this flag
allows names of arbitrary length, with dollar and underline characters.
\end{description}

\subsection{Other Flags and Arguments}
\begin{description}
\item[--a] This causes flint to include a crude cross-reference map in its
log file.
\item[--I] This flag is used to give the name of a directory to search for
include files. When it encounters an `include' statement, flint first checks
the local directory for the include file, and then checks other
directories given by the {\tt -I} switch, in the order they were present
on the command line. This is also equivalent to {\tt -i}.
\item[--?] This causes some help information to be printed.
\end{description}

\subsection{Bugs and Shortcomings}
Flint has a number of bugs and shortcomings, in addition to those described
above. Flint is intended to be run on a FORTRAN that a compiler would
accept. During the early stages of program development, a good FORTRAN compiler
is a far better tool to find programming problems. Flint bugs and
shortcomings include:
\begin{itemize}
\item IMPLICIT statements are ignored.
\item EQUIVALENCE statements are rcudely treated.
\item A number of archaic, poor or non-standard FORTRAN features are not
recognized. These include the ASSIGN statement and assigned GOTO, alternate
return statements, PAUSE, ENTRY, DECODE, ENCODE, many
archaic forms of i/o statements, NAMELIST and many VMS extensions.
\item While BYTE, INTEGER*2, INTEGER*4, REAL*4, REAL*8, etc statements are
recognized, a warning message is generated, Flint otherwise treats these
variables as either standard INTEGERs or REALs.
\item Columns 72 to 80 of an input line (if they are present) are assumed
to be part of the FORTRAN statement, rather than a comment field. Flint
generates a warning if a line contains more than 72 characters.
\end{itemize}
Flint recognizes the following extensions, and digests them without
complaint:
\begin{itemize}
\item DO/ENDDO and DOWHILE/ENDDO constructs.
\item INCLUDE statements.
\item Lower case characters are considered equivalent to upper case. Tabs
are treated as if they were the equivalent number of spaces. The full
printable ascii character set can appear in character strings.
\item A comment line starting with the hash character (\#).
\item The INTENT statement (see the section on Interface Definition Libraries).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Determining the Intent of Subroutine Arguments}
Whenever Flint finds a call to a subroutine, or the source of a subroutine,
it attempts to determine whether a subroutine argument is either input or
output (this is called an arguments intent). Usually Flint will build up its
knowledge of a particular routines arguments by analyzing many uses of the
subroutine, and generate a warning whenever inconsistent use is noted.

Note that Flint expects an argument's intent to be either input or output
or input/output. Some routines use an argument as input in some situations
and output in others. Such routines may confuse Flint, and it
may well generate spurious messages about the variable in the subroutine
call being uninitialized or redundant, or that the arguments intent is
inconsistent.

Normally Flint performs a single pass, analyzing files in the order that they
are given on the command line. When analyzing the early part of the
input source, Flints knowledge of argument intent is very poor. Thus some
problems (uninitialized and redundant variables) may be missed. There are
two recipes to partially avoid this. Firstly files on the command line
should be ordered with the files containing low level subroutines first,
and high level programs and application code last (generally interface
definition libraries should go first). Additionally inside files, the lower
level routines should be first, and higher level routines last. Secondly,
the user can ask Flint to perform two passes of the input files, by using
the {\tt -2} flag. Two passes will not necessarily correctly
determine the intent of all arguments  (in general $N$ passes will always
be enough for program with subroutine calls to a depth of $N$).

The following contrived example shows the worst case sort of behavior,
where Flint builts up its knowledge of argument intent quite slowly.
\begin{verbatim}
     subroutine a(x)
     real x
     call b(x)
     end
     subroutine b(x)
     real x
     call c(x)
     end
     subroutine c(x)
     real x
     write(*,*)x
     end
\end{verbatim}
It would require three passes for Flint to determine that the
intent of argument {\tt x} in subroutine {\tt a} was input
(the first pass would determine the intent of {\tt x} in {\tt c}, the
second would determine the intent of {\tt x} in {\tt b}). Usually
Flint determines argument intents by other means than just allowing information
to bubble up from the lowest level to the higher level routines. But in the
above example, none of these could be applied. One of the techniques is
derived from initialization checking (described under the {\tt -i} flag).
When determining intent accurately is important, and if the initialization
checking algorithm is failing (i.e. producing spurious messages), then
initialization checking should be disabled.

Small changes can significantly change the number of passes needed to uncover
all intent information. For instance, in the example above, if
the ordering of the routines was reversed (i.e. {\tt c} first and {\tt a}
last), or if a piece of code such as
\begin{verbatim}
      call a(1.0)
\end{verbatim}
appeared before subroutine {\tt a}, then Flint would require only one pass.

\subsection{Interface Definition Libraries}
It is a common (normal) situation in program development to have a library
of standard functions and routines. Though Flint knows the interface
definitions (i.e. number, type and intent of each argument) of standard
FORTRAN
functions, it is desirable for users to build and use a file (or
files) describing the interfaces to their own library. This section describes
the features in Flint to achieve this.

Flint can output a text file, in a pseudo-FORTRAN, which contains interface
descriptions of all the routines that it has encountered in this run. The
format is:
\begin{verbatim}
     flint -o file ....
\end{verbatim}
Each routine in the output file will probably contain many `{\tt INTENT}'
statements (part of the FORTRAN-8X standard). INTENT is used to indicate
whether a
subroutine argument is input to or output from a routine (or both),
or whether this is unknown. Typically a routine description would look
like:
\begin{verbatim}
      subroutine example(arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4)
      real arg1,arg2
      integer arg3,arg4
      intent(in) arg1,arg3
      intent(out) arg3,arg4
      intent(unknown) arg2
      end
\end{verbatim}
Here Flint believes {\tt arg1} is input, {\tt arg4} is output, and {\tt arg3}
is both input and output. Flint could not determine whether {\tt arg2} was
input or output.

The user can edit an interface file created by Flint, or create an
entire interface description by hand.

Such an interface description file appears as normal FORTRAN to Flint, so it
can be input to Flint (to teach Flint about a users standard routine interfaces)
on subsequent uses of Flint. While these interface definitions could
be input along with normal source files, preceding the interface file with
the {\tt -l} (library) switch has the advantage that the source of this
file does not appear in the listing file. Warning messages generated by
analyzing this file are also suppressed.

The following example generates a interface description file, {\tt library.dat},
from source files {\tt routine1.for, routine2.for} and {\tt routine3.for}.
The interface definition is then used in a subsequent Flint run on
{\tt program.for}.
\begin{verbatim}
     flint -o library.dat routine1.for routine2.for routine3.for
     flint -l library.dat program.for
\end{verbatim}

\section{RATTY}\index{ratty}
RATTY is a FORTRAN preprocessor, which is intended to simplify the job of
developing code that is to run on several machines.
RATTY checks for some non-ANSI or dubious programming
practises, secondly it converts some FORTRAN extensions into standard
FORTRAN, and thirdly it handles some compiler directives associated with
conditional compilation or code optimization.

Apart from the
extra trouble of running the preprocessor before compilation,  preprocessors
are generally a nuisance, in that they make the code that is developed
and the code that is debugged different (both compile and run time debugging).
This tends to complicate the debugging process. To this end, RATTY
attempts to make the minimum changes necessary to code to get it to compile.
Comments and indentation are retained in the output, so that the output
should
be nearly as readable as the input. Additionally when 
conditional compilation directives are avoided, it will be found that much
code does not need to be preprocessed on a number of compilers.

\subsection{The Command}
The command is:
\begin{verbatim}
     % ratty [-s system] [-I incdir] [-D symbol] [-b] [-?] input output
\end{verbatim}
``Input'' is a text file containing a mildly extended FORTRAN, whereas
``output'' is the resultant standard (?) code. The default input and
output are the standard input and standard output. A few command line
flags are also recognized.
\begin{description}
\item[-s] The string following this flag indicates the target compiler.
RATTY performs some special processing for the following
compilers:
\begin{description}
\item[vms] VAX/VMS FORTRAN compiler.
\item[cft] Cray FORTRAN compiler for both CTSS and COS.
\item[f77] UNIX FORTRAN-77 compiler.
\item[convex] Convex C-1 compiler.
\item[fx] Alliants compiler.
\item[trace] Multiflow Trace computers.
\item[sun] Sun computers.
\end{description}
RATTY assumes that target compilers other than these are strict FORTRAN-77
compilers.
\item[-I] The string following this flag indicates an alternate directory to
search for include files. The -I flag can occur several times, giving several
directories. When opening include files, first the current directory is
check, and then each directory given by the -I flag is check in the order
in which they appeared on the command line.
\item[-D] The name following this flag is treated as if it appeared in a
\#define statement. Note that unlike the cc compiler, a space is required
between the -D and the name.
\item[-b] If this flag is given, every backslash in the input is converted to
two backslashes in the output. This is useful when the target compiler
treats backslash as an ``escape character'' (i.e. several UNIX FORTRAN
compilers).
\item[?] This causes some help (on using ratty) to be printed.
\end{description}

\subsection{Language Extensions}
RATTY coverts converts the following language extensions into standard
FORTRAN, where necessary.
\begin{itemize}
\item Tab characters are replaced with the corresponding number of blanks.
\item DO/ENDDO and DOWHILE/ENDDO can be replaced with standard FORTRAN-77
loops.
\item The IMPLICIT NONE and IMPLICIT UNDEFINED statements may be converted
to the form required by the local compiler, or eliminated altogether.
\item INCLUDE files are expanded.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optimization Directives}
Vector computers occasionally need directives to help optimize some
loops. The needed directives, however, vary between manufacturers. RATTY
takes optimization directives in a standard form and converts them to
the form recognized by the target compiler. A directive is
introduced by either a
`c\#' or a `\#' starting a line (i.e. starting in column 1), for example:
\begin{verbatim}
  c#directive
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
  #directive
\end{verbatim}
Either form can be used, but the `c\#' form is preferable, as 
the directive will be seen as a comment to a standard
compiler. The directives are:
\begin{description}
\item[ivdep] This instructs the compiler to ignore any apparent
vector dependencies in the immediately following loop.
This is modestly commonly used.
\item[maxloop nn] This indicates that the loop count of the immediately
following loop will not exceed `nn'. This enables the compiler to
optimize some short loops. For example
\begin{verbatim}
  c#maxloop 32
      do i=1,n
         .
         .
      enddo
\end{verbatim}
indicates that the do loop will not execute more than 32 times.
\item[nooptimize] This directive appears just before a do-loop that should
not be optimized.
\end{description}

\subsection{Conditional Compilation Directives}
When coding a task for several machines, it is sometimes desirable that
different code is executed for different machines. For example, to
achieve good efficiency,
the inner loops may need to be different on a scalar and vector
machine.

The basic syntax is the same as the optimization directives (i.e.
`c\#' or `\#' starting a line, followed by the directive). However,
as code using conditional compilation will have to be passed through
RATTY to produce the correct code, the `\#' form is preferred.
This will be seen as an error by a standard compiler, thus preventing
code from accidently no being passed through the preprocessor.

There are four directives of interest, namely {\tt ifdef, ifndef,
else} and {\tt endif}. Like the cpp preprocessor, {\tt ifdef} and
{\tt ifndef} pass the following section of code to the compiler
if a particular ``symbol'' is defined or not.  Currently there
are only one or two symbols that are defined. Firstly
a symbol with the compiler target name is defined (the target compiler name
is gained from the command line -s flag). Secondly a symbol
``vector'' is defined if the target computer is a vector
machine. For example the command line:
\begin{verbatim}
   % ratty -s cft input output
\end{verbatim}
causes the symbol `cft' and `vector' to become defined.
Then, given the following code
fragment from ``input'', the first section is copied to ``output'', whereas the
second is discarded.
\begin{verbatim}
     #ifdef cft
        .
        .  Use this code on the Cray.
        .
     #else
        .
        .  This code on all other machines.
        .
     #endif
\end{verbatim}
